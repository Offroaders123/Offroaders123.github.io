    "about": "[Jan 19 '26]\r\nJust started this thing today. Pulled together a bunch of the names I had written down from the last few months.\r\n\r\nThis song was very improv-based, in the spirit of fun playing, more than anything else. I think my playing has been very solo-focused as of lately, probably because of having just bought Ziltoid lately, and listening to my old work again, from around the Scary House days. Realized that I haven't had as much improv in terms of writing. It usually starts with a vision, then I make a song \"mathematically\" around it. That has it's merit, and I love writing like that. I do miss some of these jam sessions though. This harks back to that, in spirit.\r\n\r\nWith practicing 3 note per string a bunch for some reason, that seems to be the playing style inspiration from this. It is on my Orville, in standard tuning.\r\n\r\nI took mixing queues from The Who, Tommy. Love the stereo usage, trying that out again, but with that as a reference. Took some mixing and mastering queues from the Robot Dog Studio channel.\r\n\r\nOh yeah and I think the improv-based playing is inspired by listening to Keneally a ton as of recently, both because I am more into it very much again, but also because I will be going to see him up at The Baked Potato on Wednesday.\r\n\r\nThis song [Psychosis] was the first time I bounced all of the tracks as stems, then mixed from there, rather than mixing from the takes themselves (configurable DAW plugins; now they are baked in, I have to use mixing to make it work on it's own instead, rather than going back and adjusting the literal tones).\r\n\r\nIt's a Logic Pro bass amp sim, Neural Amp Modeler for the Mesa-like sound, and another tone with NAM for the clean one. Just Logic drums too, tapped out on my iPad with Logic Remote connected to my Mac with USB-C for ultra-low latency. It very much helps with the MIDI not breaking when I do blast beats.\r\n\r\nThe artwork wasn't intended to look insanely similar to Scambot 1 [but it does], sorry about that. It seems like it just does though, so yeah, it's a bit on the nose in terms of reference. But that's okay. The music kind of is as well, so aah. haha\r\n\r\nUsing two stages of compression for guitar takes is killer, don't be afraid of it! I actually don't mind the mix here. It was hackily done, but I used my ear, and I think it's actually fairly clear, while a bit quirky.\r\n\r\nI tried using Voxengo for the Mid-Side field, but it didn't sound nice for this specific panning, so I didn't use it here. Was also going to use Sketch Cassette, but it didn't seem like it needed it.\r\n\r\nThe title of [Psychosis] is about how everyone nowadays is in psychosis because of social media. Because apps use webviews to render their pages, rather than being an actual app (inconsequential, just a funny observation), people are just using the Internet, but through a dumbed-down filter, where the site picks what you search for. So rather than using the Internet where you get to pick where your interest goes, instead you have the site do it for you. And the \"app\" part of it is made to seem like it's personal to you. Idk. Just making up reasons as to how I came up with that name. Some names I come up with in bed just as I am falling asleep, then I get up probably 10 times as I come up with a different bunch of names and have to go write them down. So they don't necessarily make sense to describe after the fact, it's like the remnants of your thoughts in your mind are circling down the sleepy drain, and you are writing them down as they clear out. Yeah.\r\n\r\nSo this may turn into a project, we'll see. I like the improv side of things again, and trying out more mixing experiments could be fun with it. Open-ended again. It just feels natural. This is fun right now, that solo-based 3 note per string soloing band kind of sound. I haven't done too too much of it since having moved to Logic, so it is kind of a curiosity as to how it might sound with a good mix and master. :)\r\n\r\nToday is the 1/19 by the way, as this probably will be a long-running project :)\r\n\r\nedit: A few minutes later, after publishing this :)\r\nI think my playing/recording [in the past] was more driven around what was fun to hear when I was playing, rather than being inspired by what I was listening to. Maybe in some way or another it was inspired by it, but it was very feel-driven before. Like nowadays maybe I would get inspired by a sound, then use that to create the song, in terms of what it was started from. But early on, it was that I would record by ear, like if I were to play a band as myself. Then this is what would get tracked in as a specific song. That's what this is trying out with again. I think I kind of forgot about this kind of writing I used to do. I think my current listening habits might have been inspired by it too, so it kind of goes both ways. So rather than letting the instrument lead the song where it goes, I have been having an inspiration from something in the world, and write around that thing. So maybe it's more emotion-based than I had realized? Maybe just not with words as much. Like when I used to \"mess around\" on guitar back when, I would have one track that I came up with, then I would listen back and see what else I could come up with for that. It still does that with the inspired-writing, but it has to cater to the aesthetic it's trying to convey or explain. This instead is more about the flow of what the instrument is trying to play.\r\n\r\nAnd by solo-based writing, I mean that in the compositional-sense. The way I am playing the guitar is less about riffs in the genre sense, and more about the building-block sense. It's up to much more interplay, ear-based listening, fun little calls back and forth. So recording a guitar idea, this is more akin to that, than making a song on it's own, at least I feel. The starting clean track for this song is more like what ideas I would record with Music Memos than what I would make a song with now. Again, not good or bad, just great to learn what I use and have used as song structures over time. My early guitar albums were very much driven by this solo-based writing. I miss it! And yeah, I think I forgot how to do it. It does make it to where the work can't have as much of a clear vision though, and maybe that's why I may have moved away from it for some time, to learn how to make music around the vision; even if I didn't know what the vision might be, per se. I get a feeling of where the arrow points, and I follow that. For this, there is no arrow, only vibe. It's like sitting in a hot tub, vs reading a history book. This is the hot tub. And it's fucking bubbly as fuck. Fuck.\r\n\r\nOh yeah. And [Psychosis] wasn't recorded to a click, intentionally. I haven't done that in a while, and that is an aspect to the demo nature of things that was present back then too. Because it was composed as just a demo, that's how it was presented too, at least in terms of how counterparts intermingled and things like that. Note that it's never meant to be demo quality, that's part of why I got so bummed with how my music sounded in 2023. It's supposed to be kind of like a demo in terms of inspiration/improv, but not quality. I like the rawness of first takes, but I want the production quality of albums. That's what I have been aiming for for a long time.\r\n\r\nIf this song were to be more like something from Tommy, it definitely needs vocals. I do want to look into making vocal songs. Maybe I can find a way to get vocal-based writing onto this project. I think it would probably allow for it somehow. Not sure where it would fit into the writing stage though. A song like this for example, would be too busy with vocals in it. It's already a bit busy, just right on the line I think. If I had turned on Low Latency Monitoring, it would have helped the first 7 minutes of the song. That's okay, now remembered for next time. It's more crucial even more so when the metronome is off.\r\n\r\nEdit Jan 20:\r\n\r\nOkay, new concept. I didn't like the mix of the first song. So I tried making a second mix. Learned how much I actually really like the sound of mono drums. New realization. The gain staging and master compression is a bit better in my opinion too, the first take was a bit too quiet and inconsistent. I think it was because I was in tutorial hell a bit too much, and wasn't as creative with it. So these are the same stems for Mix 2, but a stronger gain mix, and a different stereo field. I also was interested again today about a classic recording sound, so I tried that out. This one was inspired by some Ozzy that was on at work. I seemingly like the cut highs on the recording, so I tried that with Linear Phase EQ on the master. Mono drums, relatively hard panned guitars, but with Voxengo to fill out the Mid-Side channel. Makes hard panned sound great in my opinion. Feels very filled-out. And ChromaGlow with Sketch Cassette really makes it sound crushed. That combined with the lower highs, it does sound like a classic recording I feel. I don't know if it's necessarily a great sound yet, not \"clear\", but I wasn't really going for that either. So maybe that's what this project is, idk. Maybe I will try mixing the same song in different ways and see what happens. That could be fun. So far I like Mix 2 the best I think. Just fixed some of the issues from earlier.\r\n\r\nWas going to use room reverb, but I didn't want it to get lost in the crush noise of the master production. Maybe Mix 3 will have that clean sound I like, and or with room reverb. Many iterations at hand here. Maybe this can just be a \"fun\" project, rather than a statement or something. It's a statement about learning I guess. Experiment, and don't worry about it! Lots to learn about here. May be neat for me to pick up on different things I like to do in terms of production, too.\r\n\r\nEdit Jan 23:\r\nLast night, I was seemingly inspired by the concept of \"composing\", in the literal sense. Rather than just \"creating\" or improving, I was curious about the concept of arrangement, and stacking parts which complement each other. I think I have sort of utilized this in the past, this time it was more intentional I think. I wanted each part to have a purpose. Not shure (typo, kind of a funny pun lol) how these songs relate to each other in style yet, but now I am starting to like what this project has going for it. Excited to see what other things I try moving forward. I think getting \"The Universe Will Provide + Parallel Universe\" from the Keneally show up at The Baked Potato, and with watching DTP \"Higher\" again, and watching his podcast about how progress for The Moth was going, and how he had to write out all of the queues for the in-ear for each of the band members (orchestra included), for whatever reason this kind of stuck in my brain. I'm not one (yet, maybe?) to listen to exclusively orchestral music, I think maybe my ear is a little more receiving to understanding arrangement and things like that now though, and I think the MKBFD show exemplified that, too. Realizing that I was interested in the way each of the players complemented each other, and it is in a rock setting, I love and loved that. That's what I love about The Aristocrats too.\r\n\r\nSo yeah, with all of that in mind, I kind of turned my \"interest\" brain and \"logic\" brain off, and just tried to create a piece where each part was meant to work with the part next to it. I made these songs, tracks 2/3/4 on my phone, just in bed lol. I even tried out to \"hackily\" mix the tracks in GarageBand *only*, using my new fangled knowledge of EQ curves and compression per track. Wow, that, along with proper gain staging headroom (turn everything down BEFORE you start mixing!), it seems much much better in terms of clarity. I think the clarity of my Logic mixes may still be a little better. But that being said, I did it just with my phone speakers, no headphones even. I don't know the EQ reference curve of my iPhone speakers, so I just went with it. I am fairly familiar with how things sound on there though, so maybe that helped it a bit too, it's not a totally blind mix. I didn't have any gain meters, loudness meters, or things like that though, since GB iOS is very limited in that way. So it was a great exercise to see if I could use my ear with the limited tooling that was available, very pleased with. Bounced those to lossless files, then mastered them in GB iOS as well. Again, blind, since there's barely any meters or a mixing pane. But light compression followed by some light EQ, it seemed to really work well. GB iOS only bounces at 44.1/24, so I opened it in Logic on my Mac to merely raise the loudness with my LUFS meter in hand, and a limiter. Then I bounced that with POWr #2, at 44.1/16. So there was only that second stage of mastering, merely for loudness adjustment and limiting of unexpected peaks which GB iOS doesn't clip.\r\n\r\nVery happy with the results, considering it was mostly by ear.\r\n\r\nSo again, this does prove, both in general and to myself, it's not necessarily the tools, it's how you use them, or rather, whether you know how to utilize them effectively. In other words, I did not know how to before haha.\r\n\r\nI think the biggest thing here might actually be the carving EQ for each of the pieces in the arrangement, it really does wonders. Leave room for bass guitar, leave room for strings, leave room for drums, and if anything, bring the drums down a little to where it leaves room for other things. So reverse to what I believed a few years ago, less volume and less EQ is the answer, not more. You cut room for each instrument, rather than raise each one on top of the other. It's like a puzzle, but to where you cut out the divots, rather than cut the notches off, and tape them onto edges that didn't have them. Uh, yeah.\r\n\r\nA great example is Bugabot Camelot, I think it actually sounds great, even if the song compositionally \"sucks\". I like it, that's besides the point. Maybe it's more an exercise than anything. I find I can't play MIDI guitar, bass, or strings very well at all, so maybe that's why it sounds like that. MIDI keyboard works nicely though, as you can hear from tracks 2/3.\r\n\r\nI also am not a fan of quantization. I'd rather hear the little hiccups, I really don't care about them at this point. If you can play relatively in time, your brain can hear what you were attempting to do. It sounds more realistic too, even if it's with not as high tech MIDI sounds. I honestly kind of like the unique sound of it, in a familiar kind of way. Like it sounds pedestrian or something.\r\n\r\nI also realized this week while going back through some of my older work that I did tend to over-EQ things, so I tried to use more cutting, and less raising in general. Like if I wanted to raise the treble of the guitar for example, only raise it at most like 1db, rather than 2 or 4. Some of my older mixes feel a bit sharp, like they are pointy. Very bassy, and very trebley. So that is another thing I am experimenting with, albeit not cognizant of it. Rather than trying to EQ the shit out of the master, just make sure the faders sound correct to begin with, and that the EQ of each track is leaving room for one another. Then when mastering, it's more about compression, light EQ to brighten everything a little (and cut the mud, aka 150-300 range), then a limiter and loudness check to make sure the playback is at a nice consistent volume from track to track. And yes, compression doesn't need to be insane, I personally am setting my loudness to around 12 LUFS. I can't quite decide whether to use higher LUFS. Some say they go around 9, I guess it just depends which you like. May do some experimenting in that regard. I also like the idea of having track to track LUFS changes, seems like a nice composition tool too, dynamics in the album sense, since the album is a cohesive work, in concept, too.\r\n\r\nI also used some light automation for parts which were a little too loud throughout the song, on track 3 (Sofa). It was kind of inspiring to use it more as a mixing tool, rather than a creative sound. I think that's been one of the biggest changes to learn over getting into mixing and mastering. It's that you are making the sound of it more defined, rather than doing creative changes to the message it's conveying. Back on early projects like Made in merica, I used automation, but as a compositional creative aspect to the writing process. It wasn't about the mixing part of it. So now it makes a lot more sense, you just write the song as is, then use automation to emphasize certain parts where they should shine, as you understand them to need to be. This is much different, and I love it. Just a different mindset to be in.\r\n\r\nSo this project is very much open-ended so far, where I am aiming for high-quality, not perfection though. Hitting the target isn't the point, it's that I aimed for it, and I am getting closer to \"the bullseye\". The point is that writing, composing, mixing, all of it, it's a moving target too, though. I like that though. Like many other things, it ends up spiraling into something more that you had no idea about. Programming was like that too. I got into it for web dev, frontend specifically. I now write Rust projects, who knew?\r\n\r\nAnd I am bouncing to 44.1/16 because for me at least, I don't see that as not being a logical target. I know some streaming platforms allow for higher sources, but I am not one personally to discern how it is better in terms of a listening or distribution medium. It's one thing to record with high bitrates and sample rates, I do believe in that, and I do do that. The processing leaves more room for various concepts, which others have explained much better than I (Monty Montgomery, check out the videos he's made on YouTube). So until I am perceptive to the benefits of a listening experience higher than CD quality, I will release at CD quality. Archival and captures of things like vinyl, again I understand why you would want to capture as much detail as possible. In terms of the delivery format and what listeners listen with, CD quality seems to be the sweet spot. As I've mentioned, I use dithering when going from 24 to 16 bit as well, even if it doesn't \"make a difference\". I'd rather use it than not. And since I like to make CDs of my work anyways, I would rather not have it so that digital copies are of differing quality to physical releases. If you own the CD, you should have the best quality, the same as everything else. That would be annoying if you wanted the physical copy, but the Bandcamp version had more quality. I wouldn't buy both, would you? It's just more of a headache. Those are just my opinions though, which I have gathered over the past year or so.\r\n\r\nAnd as to why my older releases fluctuate in sample rate and bitrate? I didn't know any better, and I had \"understood\" that \"higher quality is better\". So yeah, not much reasoning, I just didn't know enough about it, so I just bounced the best that I could. Mind you, with less than clear mixes as well. So it's not like you are benefitting from that high quality.\r\n\r\nGarageBand iOS only seems to bounce at 44.1/24 anyways, so it's not like 48khz is always an option. It used to bounce at 48/24, but that seemed to have been an accident or something? I think it was always labeled as 44.1/24, but it was upsampling it by default, eek. Glad they changed it at least. And recording audio tracks in GB iOS seems to only be at 44.1 too, so at some point you'd have to upscale things at some point anyways.\r\n\r\nWhen doing projects in Logic Pro exclusively though, I always use 48/24. Then I master those sources, and bounce to 44.1/16 with dither, for the final masters. Ideally one would probably bounce it all at 48/24, then dither separately, but I am not on the side of having wanted to do that yet. Again, once I have a reason to learn to do otherwise, then that is different. Just like how I bounced at \"the highest quality available\" because it was \"best\". I don't know why I would currently need 48/24 masters, if anything I can still go and bounce it from the mastering project too, since everything was already rendered from the mix tracks anyways (no worries about external plugin changes). Of course I guess unless Voxengo Mid-Side were to change or something, then eegh. \r\n\r\nEverything comes in small increments. I will probably bounce as both down the road, when a project permits as such. I am just happy with the mixes now, so much better than the past. \"You can't build Rome in a day\"!\r\n\r\nOh yeah, and I haven't listened to the Universe CDs yet, just the thought of how the arrangement for those, as well as his band, that was the inspiration for things.",

        "about": "Just recorded this today (Jan 26 2:43 PM as of writing). Been listening to some of my older work, which I think I have mention again. Wow. Really had a lot of great things going back then. Not from a third person [ego] perspective, I am merely saying in that I realize how strong my vision was for what I was dreaming to create, and I think merely my knowhow was the thing holding the work back from being what it could be.\n\nThis song today was recorded on my iPhone with GarageBand iOS. I used my iRig 2, a Lightning 3.5 mm adapter, [iPhone 12 mini], and earbuds for monitoring. This is how I recorded the first few guitar albums back then. I thought it would carry forward similarly in creative intuition to the other installments from this project thus far. So it's very much rooted in that original creative drive that I seemingly have had a tough time to rediscover. It's okay that that's the case, and I can't explain enough how great it has been to remember what it was exactly that was present when recording those, and why I may have lost sight of it over time. I could probably go make a podcast about this, and I probably will. As a pre-empasis explainer, the creation of it is where the golden ticket has to be located. That comes first. It's not something you can build, learn, or whatever other actionable thing you can do to \"get it\". If you *want* to make a song, a song will come out. If you want to *have* a song, it will sound like absolute trash. Or at least your feeling and sentiment to it will be as such.\n\nThis state of mind I am rekindling, it's that open-ended inspiration, where you are just experimenting, having fun, and just making do with what is. There has to be a lot at play for that mindset to be present, and healthy. Maybe it has to do with mental health, or merely listening to your mind and body. Whatever the \"magic potion\" is, that seems to be the case for me at least. I need sleep, food, no stress, or emotional strife. I very much am understanding again how this all connects together. Where you are coming from when you sit down to write, that's the entire thing. So if you are coming at it from an angle that isn't going to help you, don't expect positive results, I mean in the way that you discern how you did.\n\nOkay, yeah. So this was with my Orville, using only GarageBand drums (SoCal I think?), and the built-in amp sims. I used my 5 string SDGR bass (the one I use for all my own bass tracks; there's only the one bass :) ), again built-in amp sim.\n\nI only used earbuds for the monitoring process. I did all of the mixing with merely my phone speakers. The goal is and has been (for tracks on this project which apply) to again start looking into the limitations of what you can do with what you have. This is how I learned so much about what I do now. I love that mechanism for learning. I specifically didn't use the earbuds because the EQ and just general audio presence is horrible. I got them at Target for like $10, I just needed them for the plane ride to SquiggleConf, and I wanted to get familiar (in my more recent role as an audio engineer/mindset) with low-quality hardware listening. I need to know what different \"distribution targets\" sound like. It's like how you view your frontend at different browser/screen sizes. You want to know how a mix will carry across different systems.\n\nYeah. So I did the mix on my phone speakers, landscape (stereo speakers). The goal as I think I've mentioned has been to really work on a solid mix, as that goes the longest way. That seems to have helped dramatically. Gain stage much below full scale. Pan instruments to fill out the stereo field. Ensure volume sounds okay where each instrument pokes out just right enough so you can hear each one. Where each instrument overlaps in frequency range, cut EQ paths for each one to leave room for which one you want in front. Think of this like z-index for CSS, where you might be lowering the opacity a bit of certain elements too. Maybe you want the edge of a card to show through to what's behind it. Or you could use clip-path. You just don't want the background to fully fall away, or the two to create an incoherently blurred or colored blob. That's what EQing does to leave room for each part.\n\nOkay, then I bounced all of that into a 44.1/24 file (using GB iOS for the bounce). I then mastered it in a new project. I did some automation to make the start and end of the track a little more easy on the ears (sound-stage speaking), and applied compression and EQ as necessary to make the final file sound more cohesive (opinionated, weighted into what you feel is more sonically pleasing to your ears/what your vision of how the song should sound is). Then I bounced that master to another 44.1/24 file.\n\nI then opened it one more time with Logic on my Mac. I was planning on only doing loudness management (LUFS checking), where I add a limiter to manage peaks, and raise the gain to make the LUFS more streamlined with the other songs on the project.\n\nI then felt when listening on my Mac speakers (again, trying to low-budget see how/whether I can get things done without a lot of gear) that the track needed one more layer of compression (felt too dynamic, hard to hear quiet parts, loud parts too jarring), and the EQ could use a bit trimming of the low-end and high-end (and a little bit more mud cleanup). So I use Linear Phase EQ for that.\n\nThe stack for it was a Vintage VCA (tried that, and somehow felt giddy when listening to how great it made it sound. Not sure why it felt and different, just went with that emotional response to the sound of it. So, I don't know why it's better quite yet, but I responded to it, so I am taking that instinct as a learning moment; progress, instincts trusted over logic!!), and the default settings were great, I just adjusted it slightly to whatever \"felt\" right (weighted, hard to explain). Then it was the Linear EQ (helps prevent phase issues on the master), and finally the Limiter with the gain increases (up to 12 LUFS average).\n\nI then felt the stereo field felt a bit shallow, or rather that the center felt a bit empty. I now started to get another another understanding for mastering, in the concept of working on the stereo field. I placed a Voxengo Sound Delay on the Mid-Side route, and tried a few different delays. Setting the x0.01 setting to 4 sounded magical for some reason. Again, flipping back and forth, I can hear how it adds the center, I just don't quite get why it made it so neat sounding. I tried turning it on and off, and with the Mid-Side present it definitely sounded much more full, the panning was much more cohesive. Then I would solo the 'mid channel' (not a real channel, just a perceptive one, very intriguing), and it really does just sound like a mono mixdown of the entire mix. So I think that's what's placed in the center of it.\n\nThe drums are still stereo, I'm not sure how I can make them mono in GB iOS. Maybe I could do a Merge Tracks action of some sort? I think that usually keeps it stereo though.\n\nBut yeah, Voxengo was just before the Limiter. I then made sure one more time it was set to 12 LUFS, then that was that! Bounced at 44.1/16 with POWr #2 dithering, and called it a day! Now it's 3:11 PM, and I am going to finish the edit for this.\n\nThe takeaway from today: The vision was never the thing to fix, it's to put focus on how you articulate the vision, and to make that stronger. Learning, experimenting, practicing, and making your own conclusions and opinions about how you work, that's how you are then able to make your vision into reality.\n\nKeep creating friends! It's really fun.\n\nLove ya.\nBrandon\n\nP.S.\n\nAs I was finishing the bass track, near the end of the song my posture wasn't too nice, just getting cozy while playing. My head was resting on the wood of the bass, and my nose kind of smelt it a little. Hence, the title. The peculiarity again was what made it stuck.\n\nAnd for this track, things were recorded much like Gridelda the Snitch. Have been wanting to try that out again for some time now. It's that a singular improvisation is the root of the source for the track, but when recording the other parts, you *only* listen to that one when recording the other parts on top. I think what I like about it is that your mind isn't trying to write around the other parts, and they end up working together, but in their own worlds. It almost makes it sound like multiple people are playing, rather than it all being one written part. So I only ever heard my current instrument, and the drums, when tracking. Then I mixed it from there, hearing all the parts together. I actually haven't even heard the song all the way through being finalized, yet. That's also kind of interesting about my projects too, in that I sometimes don't even do a full listen before I release it. So it's just as much of a discovery to me as it is to you. Really neat.\n\nYeah, Lordsmith, Transcend, and Scary House have been in rotation as of recently. Really like and liked what energy was going on during that time, and I think I am finding it again, as I mentioned probably 20 minutes ago, just above.\n\nAnd another thing, it probably explains why things get so far out of time with one another. If one track has delay, and I play that, it introduces that into the monitoring when recording the next track, and the next one. And the next one. Say I record the drums. Not much delay. I record guitar with that as a reference. Probably a little bit of delay. I then record another guitar part. My mind might start listening to the first guitar part for ear reference. But then that makes it 2x delayed. So now it's way off from the drums. Then I go to record bass guitar, and the beats and transients and too hard to discern to improvise with, so then you get frustrated and start making a bunch of weird noises because you are annoyed. Then you get annoyed that you messed up your song. You lose train of thought, and the song idea is lost to time. Then you go to mix the song, and the recording frustrates you, because it's so out of time. And since the song was improvised, that's the only take. So there's no reference to what you were thinking back then, so you can't really go back and re-record it, as the idea is gone. Then all of that internalizes itself into being \"what kind of musician you are\", or \"what kind of music you play\", or \"do you play music? Yeah I try\". Lack of confidence. Not thinking what you make is real. And it was all because of monitoring delay. Man. That sucks. And maybe all of that was present to begin with, and it merely brought it to the surface. Maybe low self-esteem was a problem regardless of whether your DAW has low latency. Maybe the mix sucks because you didn't yet have the ear training to discern or understand what makes good mixes good. And why would you expect yourself to have had that training, when you hadn't trained for it? So with all of that in mind, stop being so fucking god damn hard on yourself, it's okay man! You're killing it, and maybe just find out when, why, and how things aren't working out how you'd like, then reconfigure your goals around that. That's actionable.\n\n[I; me] Love it. This is awesome. Music has taught me so much.\n\nAnd don't worry about hiding those \"mistakes\" along the way. Because showing all of that progress only helps you see how much you've grown, and it provides a reference point to others to teach them how you got to where you are at, and it can help them see what things may be helpful to arriving at their vision, too. Not everyone has the same vision. That's beautifully baffling too. Not that I would expect everyone to. Just, in that, take a moment and think about that. Isn't that amazing? There's so many different goals and things people want from life.\n\nLife is fucking beautiful, unc.\n❤️",

    "about": "[from YouTube]\nWe are lucky to be here. Remember the soil under your feet. Remember to stop and look at that view. Remember to tell your loved ones you love them. Do not take your time here for granted.\n[ok back to the original description]\n\nOkay, might be working on a new album, not totally sure. Just making what I am making, and then seeing where it goes. I'm not one usually for singles. But I am too eager to release these, they make me too happy with how they sound. So maybe they will eventually be compiled into a project after the fact. These are the only two songs I have made so far. It's not that I am releasing them out of a selection of songs I don't like. It's just that they feel like they need to be made public right now. I'm just following that intuition. I don't know how they fit together. I just know that they are what I need to be making.\n\nThis one was a guitar improvisation with my Orville Les Paul. Used some new plugins, and the new mixing/mastering techniques I mentioned in the previous song.\n\nThe song felt like it was to be called Glide. It was going to have a paper airplane on the cover, but I felt like an \"improvised\" cover might make more sense for the art. Just been feeling that lately. The artwork kind of brought my mind into feel like it's a place or time you \"aren't meant to reach\". Not in a negative light, but more in that you accessed something very deep, and it's a glimpse of the depths and or beauty that it provides. Might be a metaphor or something, I don't know. The noise on the artwork seemingly pairs nicely with the tape static present in the reverb of the track too. I like that. And the haziness of the blur seems to represent the kind of distortion that seems to occur at the concluding few minutes of the track.\n\nI think it's being very in the moment, and or emotional, this song, this state. Just being, there.\n\nIn the logical side of things, I was listening to my compilation album recently, and I think Down in the Rains of Time made a new impression on me again. I love the depth of it.\n\nI tuned my guitar to that \"random\" open tuning again too, it just felt like it needed to.\n\nWait, that reminds me. This was actually on my Ibanez Gio. I don't want to tune my Orville up and down a lot.\n\nI think this song might also be a reflection of how much life means to me, even moreso now. Loss changes you. Time changes you. Or rather, it allows you to realize just how fragile this whole \"thing\" is. Not in that the world is dangerous all of a sudden, but just in that it really is magical to just be here, with those you love, to see the beautiful sky and plants every day. We are lucky to be here. It is amazing to remember that. Don't ever forget that.\n\n[just posted the song]\n..and while working on the artwork, I now remember that I was thinking that the album could maybe be called \"Creating Experiences\". This is an important thing that I am bringing forward in my life because of the key people that shaped me. I miss them dearly, and I wish I could thank them for our time together one more time. I think that will happen one way or another, somehow.\n\nEdit: one day later, the night.\n\nListening to this song after having listened to Nonkertompf all the way though, again. Man, that album explains so much without using any words. I don't know if Nonkertompf even has any words or lyrics in it. I love how expressive it is.\n\nThe conclusion of the listening of that led me to my song here. I have been wary lately to not compare my songs to other artists, in that sometimes it comes from a place of lack. This time I let myself go to my song though, it felt like it was coming from a place of love, understanding, relation, curiosity, something like that.\n\nWhat I had gathered while listening to this song, is that it very much seems to come from a place seemingly similar to Nonkertompf, maybe. Again, these are feelings. Usually when I write these feelings out, it tends to make me start to not believe them, because I can see them on the page. Maybe that's something I struggle with.\n\nBut, okay. At least in terms of listening habits, this song gathers from a lot of my inspirations. I think it gathers from my recent additions of DTP Ghost, Nonkertompf, and Devin/Keneally in general. The tape degradation feeling/sonic portrayal comes from Steven Wilson's influence. It's not that these things are literal concepts that I am explicitly using with intention. I think it's that it kind of works in parallel, or reciprocally. I seem to gravitate towards music which describes how I feel. I then learn to use those sounds and feelings and paint types in my music. Then it makes it visible as to where I gathered those paint feelings/aesthetics from. So it's not just that it's a composition technique only, it's also the way I felt while listening to the music when I found it. I am re-gathering those feelings again, and using those to paint my music with. So say I felt a certain way while listening to In Absentia for example (I am thinking right now of the intro to Gravity Eyelids for some reason; it's the mellotron that I love). The sound of that, the worbley effect, the emotions I felt from it, or rather how I felt the message it conveys, was perceived by me, that's the thing I am painting with. Not that In Absentia is specific to this song, that's just a relation to this.\n\nWhile listening to Nonkertompf, I was reading about all of Keneally's work over the years. The more and more I dive into his work, the more I love what he does, how he does it, and am thankful to have someone to look up to like that. It's that he does what he does because it's his story, and he's telling it, and documents it because it's important. In saying that, my own radar says \"that sounds like being full of yourself!\". My feeling is the total opposite. That's what's so beautiful and inspiring about it. In a way, it reminds me of that thing of when you are a kid, and you have your dreams, and you bring them to fruition. The reasoning of why it is logical or not, we aren't present with yet. I find it beautiful to be able to discern when that logical \"no\" is unbeneficial, and isn't helping you be happy. In some sense of things, that's why I am loving the music process so much. It's a way for you to become your own advocate, and to do what you do.\n\nI don't want to take the emotion out of this. I tend to explain things very literally. I feel very happy and relatable to so much of his process. It's the safety in feeling the innocence, and to let the process drive the work, rather than some other way.\n\nIt's hard to explain how a mental shift affects your life. It's not visible. People might not even perceive that you've changed. But this is what I am trying to articulate. It's unbelievable. I don't know how to explain it to others who don't know what it is. Not like it's some higher-knowledge extravaganza or something (or maybe it is?? lol). It's just that it's only something you can relate to if you've experienced it.\n\nMuch also like what this song was rooted in, in an emotional basis, I haven't \"understood\" loss, until now. I don't know how people experience it, or if it's the same. Of course people handle it differently, but I'm not sure everyone has the same realizations because of it. That in mind, so much of my world has changed because of it too. Let alone the loss of the person or people you love, but the unknown of not having them in your life anymore. It's the finality of it. It's that you grew up and they were always there. You knew they would be gone at some point, not to be blatant or anything. But the realization that they weren't always there either, that's also odd. And realizing that they are just like you, they were young. Not that they were the same them, but young. It's that they had to go through the ropes, just like you. You come to think that they have always known the world. When they are no longer with you, it is shattering. It's not just that they are gone. It's that you realize that they weren't always there. They didn't always know the answers. They taught you everything they learned because you are to do the same. For lack of soul-shattering words, it's beautiful. How this whole \"thing\" life works, it's amazing. The amount of depth to it is awesome. I'm not even talking about our first-person perception of everyday things, like trees, nature, the world. All of those deserve their own conversations too. Just, the experience of being here, in \"now\". It's amazing. One recurring thought I keep having is that I am thankful for having been on the same timeline as them. Because that is unfathomably lucky. Luck or not, whatever metric you'd like. The point is that I am so thankful for the time together. It's not even that it's finite. I mean, it is, but the point is that even that was more than the world, you know? This has made everything so good for me, yet also very very very heavy. I already have discerned my time against things I do or don't want to do. But now it means even more now. If I am a bit brash for wanting to stay away from negativity that would only hinder other positive things from coming about, I don't care now. Time is of the essence. We have the ability to decide what we spend our time, our focus, our connections here together. It's not about being \"preachy\" for good and bad. What does your heart say? Follow it. Put your best foot forward, because that's how you want to be remembered. It's not that you \"*should* be remembered nicely\". It's that you have the power of so much in front of you. Why get stuck focusing on things that don't matter? Getting mad that someone cut you off in traffic? Silly. Don't waste anymore energy on it. Don't skirt around an uncomfortable conversation because you don't feel like having it. It's just a feeling. It will feel better to go through with it. And the truth is out in the open. It's not doing it for the sake of doing it. It's that you are living by your heart. If people can't handle that, then you don't want them in your life. Make room for those you do care about. Rather than being mad at that other driver, go home and hug your spouse, make them a cake. Take them out to dinner, thank them for the time you have together, and how much they mean the world to you. Those are the moments you want to foster, and to bring forth for you, and for them.\n\nAgain, I don't know how to communicate this without being literal. There is a void in where I feel like I don't understand how they can not be here. Is this what existential feelings are all about? I am mourning the times cherished together have now concluded. I am cherishing that what I grew up with is now in the past. I know I am my age, that's not new. But I am realizing how \"my age\" is now not what it's felt like for the longest time. \"Being an adult\" is not new, I am a few years into it. Albeit I am still working on independence, making progress! That's surface-level stuff though. On an emotional level, I think I have been young for a long time. Something has changed. I feel it. I know it. I knew \"about\" the world, but I didn't *understand* it. Now I understand it. And it's soul-rattling. Realizing that people get mad at each other over something they misunderstood. Realizing that people hold grudges because of miscommunication. Realizing that people love each other but don't know how to communicate it. Realizing how much we all need each other. Very much. Realizing how \"negative\" everyone is. I now see why people say that kids are so happy. Is it because of these realizations about the world we live in? Or is it just another set of misunderstandings which are gained at a certain age? People start to believe that the world is out for them. People think that the world hates them. People think that others hate them. We fuel our own problems, whether cognizant or not. We also fuel our own progress, whether cognizant or not. Kids seems to \"work\" naturally, making friends, helping before not helping. The environments we grow up in tend to remove this positive light, or rather obstruct it. That's what I am working on and possibly am trying to explain. This light is still there. It's belief in things working out. You may even have factual evidence that things won't work out. But that doesn't mean that you stop trying. That's the whole point. Because what you put in is what you get out, and vice versa. What you don't put in is what you don't get out.\n\nWe learn to be okay with getting in our own way, because it's what we're \"supposed to do\". It's \"what everyone else does\". It's \"being an adult\". Fuck it. I won't do that.",

I find it beautiful to be able to discern when that logical \"no\" is unbeneficial, and isn't helping you be happy. In some sense of things, that's why I am loving the music process so much. It's a way for you to become your own advocate, and to do what you do.\n\nI don't want to take the emotion out of this. I tend to explain things very literally. I feel very happy and relatable to so much of his process. It's the safety in feeling the innocence, and to let the process drive the work, rather than some other way.\n\nIt's hard to explain how a mental shift affects your life. It's not visible. People might not even perceive that you've changed. But this is what I am trying to articulate. It's unbelievable. I don't know how to explain it to others who don't know what it is. Not like it's some higher-knowledge extravaganza or something (or maybe it is?? lol). It's just that it's only something you can relate to if you've experienced it.\n\nMuch also like what this song was rooted in, in an emotional basis, I haven't \"understood\" loss, until now. I don't know how people experience it, or if it's the same. Of course people handle it differently, but I'm not sure everyone has the same realizations because of it. That in mind, so much of my world has changed because of it too. Let alone the loss of the person or people you love, but the unknown of not having them in your life anymore. It's the finality of it. It's that you grew up and they were always there. You knew they would be gone at some point, not to be blatant or anything. But the realization that they weren't always there either, that's also odd. And realizing that they are just like you, they were young. Not that they were the same them, but young. It's that they had to go through the ropes, just like you. You come to think that they have always known the world. When they are no longer with you, it is shattering. It's not just that they are gone. It's that you realize that they weren't always there. They didn't always know the answers. They taught you everything they learned because you are to do the same. For lack of soul-shattering words, it's beautiful. How this whole \"thing\" life works, it's amazing. The amount of depth to it is awesome. I'm not even talking about our first-person perception of everyday things, like trees, nature, the world. All of those deserve their own conversations too. Just, the experience of being here, in \"now\". It's amazing. One recurring thought I keep having is that I am thankful for having been on the same timeline as them. Because that is unfathomably lucky. Luck or not, whatever metric you'd like. The point is that I am so thankful for the time together. It's not even that it's finite. I mean, it is, but the point is that even that was more than the world, you know? This has made everything so good for me, yet also very very very heavy. I already have discerned my time against things I do or don't want to do. But now it means even more now. If I am a bit brash for wanting to stay away from negativity that would only hinder other positive things from coming about, I don't care now. Time is of the essence. We have the ability to decide what we spend our time, our focus, our connections here together. It's not about being \"preachy\" for good and bad. What does your heart say? Follow it. Put your best foot forward, because that's how you want to be remembered. It's not that you \"*should* be remembered nicely\". It's that you have the power of so much in front of you. Why get stuck focusing on things that don't matter? Getting mad that someone cut you off in traffic? Silly. Don't waste anymore energy on it. Don't skirt around an uncomfortable conversation because you don't feel like having it. It's just a feeling. It will feel better to go through with it. And the truth is out in the open. It's not doing it for the sake of doing it. It's that you are living by your heart. If people can't handle that, then you don't want them in your life. Make room for those you do care about. Rather than being mad at that other driver, go home and hug your spouse, make them a cake. Take them out to dinner, thank them for the time you have together, and how much they mean the world to you. Those are the moments you want to foster, and to bring forth for you, and for them.\n\nAgain, I don't know how to communicate this without being literal. There is a void in where I feel like I don't understand how they can not be here. Is this what existential feelings are all about? I am mourning the times cherished together have now concluded. I am cherishing that what I grew up with is now in the past. I know I am my age, that's not new. But I am realizing how \"my age\" is now not what it's felt like for the longest time. \"Being an adult\" is not new, I am a few years into it. Albeit I am still working on independence, making progress! That's surface-level stuff though. On an emotional level, I think I have been young for a long time. Something has changed. I feel it. I know it. I knew \"about\" the world, but I didn't *understand* it. Now I understand it. And it's soul-rattling. Realizing that people get mad at each other over something they misunderstood. Realizing that people hold grudges because of miscommunication. Realizing that people love each other but don't know how to communicate it. Realizing how much we all need each other. Very much. Realizing how \"negative\" everyone is. I now see why people say that kids are so happy. Is it because of these realizations about the world we live in? Or is it just another set of misunderstandings which are gained at a certain age? People start to believe that the world is out for them. People think that the world hates them. People think that others hate them. We fuel our own problems, whether cognizant or not. We also fuel our own progress, whether cognizant or not. Kids seems to \"work\" naturally, making friends, helping before not helping. The environments we grow up in tend to remove this positive light, or rather obstruct it. That's what I am working on and possibly am trying to explain. This light is still there. It's belief in things working out. You may even have factual evidence that things won't work out. But that doesn't mean that you stop trying. That's the whole point. Because what you put in is what you get out, and vice versa. What you don't put in is what you don't get out.\n\nWe learn to be okay with getting in our own way, because it's what we're \"supposed to do\". It's \"what everyone else does\". It's \"being an adult\". Fuck it. I won't do that.",

Even if it's covering familiar ground, I am now seeing that I have a lot to cover there in terms of bringing up the production quality.\n\nSo yeah, this was recorded with GarageBand, exactly like the old days. Line out cable from my Line 6 Spider IV (yes), and bass amp sim from GarageBand. Drums tapped out by fingers, my own to be precise. Ibanez Gio.\n\nThe change here is that this was then mixed a few days later, and with Logic Pro. I then mastered it, properly, too. I say that because I realized I have been using compressors and limiters wrong, because I didn't realize that they don't activate if the input signal path isn't loud enough. So yeah, makes sense. Just another thing to have learned though, so all good!\n\nReally digging this song! Hear lots of my influences and previous works in it.\n\nWas intending for this to be a full project, and this just would be the first on that. But I think right now might still be a bit taxing with all of the plans I have going on at the moment. I also am just now getting over being sick, this song took a few days longer because of that. Recorded it before I started feeling bad, then had to wait to mix and master it. Finally recouping thankfully.\n\nThe big changes in production for this are mainly:\n- Flat EQ curve for monitoring while mixing/mastering\n- Beyerdynamic DT 990 Pro 250 Ohm (thanks Dad!!)\n- Proper compression gain staging\n- Direction panning instead of fader panning (they are different!)\n- Room volume adjustments (don't just plop reverb on the mix bus, each instrument should have a different amount of reverb on it, accordingly)\n- Voxengo Mid Side mastering (ties together both sides of the stereo field)\n- Linear Phase EQ for mastering\n- Normalization per stem (makes it easier to see unwanted spikes)\n- Limiter before Compression and EQ for stems (cut off those spikes just mentioned; not sure if this is good practice, but it does seem to allow the track to behave more consistently)\n\nNot new for this song specifically, but:\n- Channel EQ cuts which allow each instrument to breath in it's main EQ slot (thanks Devy!)\n- Mixing according to the mix, rather than by buses (I used to \"mix\" one track at a time, rather than mixing for the whole mix; You mix each track according to how they all work with each other; mindblowing, and makes a lot more sense)\n- Compression for each track (specifically as according to what the mix needs as a whole)\n- Mastering to LUFS rather than merely -0.1db (While it may still reach -0.1db, the goal is to master to -12 LUFS. I don't know if this is the number that I want specifically for what I need, I have to learn about which apply to what, but so far it seems to sound great. I just don't want to have it anymore where things sound harsh and inconsistent in loudness throughout a track or album. Mastering seems to help with that in general though, even if you don't use LUFS. I think I did for Recreational Outrage though, that was one of the only other projects I did that with. I used it on Izalea recently too, just the other day. That's because I am getting into using it again though. Still have to learn about how applicable it is for what I need. I do want consistent volume levels though, and no piercing high end)\n- Adjusting region offsets to account for recording latency (this one is highly significant. So much of my older work was affected by this, heavily. I thought it was my playing that was unable to stay in time [um, it still could be, but that's besides the point 😜], but it's the delay that effects introduce. Or it just might be GB iOS being GB iOS. Idk. It doesn't seem to happen when tracking with Logic on Mac though. I enjoy recording on iPad more though, so this is my solution to it. You can still hear where the timing is a bit weird, that's where I am seemingly accounting for it while in the recording itself. I had used this fix for a few other songs recently, I don't remember which. Any of the newer ones from this fall that I did on my iPad I think I did this offset fix)\n\nSo while I could span this out into the start of another album, I am too excited to have this one be complete to wait for the rest of the project to define itself. So, this shall be a single! Maybe I could release this one on it's own too? That could be something surely. Hmm. Thought of this right as I am typing this.\n\nOh yeah, and to mention GarageBand drums and the bass amp sim, really the sound in the recording was rendered with the Logic Pro equivalents, as that's what I edited and bounced it with. They are the same instruments, yet they tend to sound different between each program, as the Logic Pro ones tend to be higher quality too. For a while, I have enjoyed the novelty of the kind of finicky GarageBand instrument sounds, I kind of like how it plays into the DIY sound of my music. So I have missed that with Logic Pro. But I think I am okay with it actually sounding a little better now. I might have just been getting used to how it sounded, rather than necessarily liking it.\n\nWent crazy on the artwork for this one. This is the second attempt at it. The first one was with a picture I took of some cool clouds and some powerlines. Wasn't feeling inspired.

    "about": "As of the early morning of Dec 15 (12:58 AM lol), this is the current workings.\r\n\r\nNot mastered yet, not crossfaded.\r\n\r\nAnd yeah, this project is not done, I merely am making it as you see songs added. Will update this info with when the mastering is done and the track list is finished.\r\n\r\nStatus update: Learning how to compensate for (no not that) headphone EQ! Realized it's been affecting my mixes and masters for about 3 years now. It's and understatement actually, as everything new in terms of music I've been listening to since 2022, has been with these Sony MDR-7506s. They works great! I thought they were more transparent than they are though, and this has now come to bite me, which is okay, because I didn't even know how to discern that sort of thing itself. So it makes more sense now, I can hear it, and I can articulate (to myself, and others, I'd like to think) what is missing from the signal path, or what is too strong.\r\n\r\nIn Logic, I have a master bus plugin which adjusts the EQ to correct it while using my headphones. I disarm it when bouncing. For any other playback, there is an app I found called eqMac, highly recommend it! Works great so far. That fixes playback system-wide. I don't use it for Logic because it seems to apply a noticeable delay when tracking alongside the Focusrite Scarlett. I don't think there's much delay from eqMac in any other scenarios though, so it works great.\r\n\r\nThese are the first mixes of things. May make changes, just learning, just starting to get into open-ended experimenting and writing again. Not fully open-ended like Recreational Outrage, but we'll see. It's more that I want to try how I was writing when I was doing Catastriphic, where I would write for months on end, then (with so, many.. at least,) I would select the ones I felt fit the project the best. I want to get back into that. I think my headspace is a bit more kerfuffled at the moment though, I think just \"getting out there\" and playing a bit more, rather than always recording and or tracking/mixing, that may help. It's being close with the playing that makes you want to write, I think I tend to forget that. The idea and feeling is what leads you to want to sit down and write, not that you \"want to make a song\". The song wants to make you (what?). Yeah.\r\n\r\nThumpermonkey is awesome. Awesome I tell you, goddamn it!! Legion was inspired by them to some extent. Started listening sometime this week, it was in my wishlist for a few months I think, I found it somehow at some point. After the second listen (ever) today, I bought it right as I got home. Can't wait to get more familiar with this album.\r\n\r\nThe names are definitely off the wall this time around again, I don't know what this one is about, and I don't know what it is or isn't. I wanted to make and still want to make a heavy record, whether that's with vocals, thrashy parts, blast beats, that sort of thing. I don't seem to be able to access that right now though. I feel very much at peace internally at the moment, very balanced. So that's a very fair trade-off, haven't felt that in a long while now. Maybe that's why things are kind of coming full-circle with going back to doing things from a few years back. The feelings have settled. More work to be done, but the foundation is starting to cure! That's where all of the magic starts, my friends.\r\n\r\nChocolate sunshine! It's the cure to the farts within the fields. I don't know why I felt I needed to write that. urrhm yeah. Trucks? No, tennis rackets. ah, polyps! What an exclamation that is haha.\r\n\r\nEdit a few minutes later:\r\nShrouded, Collosus, and Bleeper are from a folder in November. Otherwise, everything else from Pelagan onwards started on 12-10. Shrouded was on Nov 13, Colossus on the 20th, and Bleeper on the 23rd. So this isn't a cohesive project yet. If anything, maybe the expanse of this project had already started, and I didn't even realized it yet. We will see what this turns out to be. I think in concept, yeah, I had already started writing material for it, but I didn't know it was a \"thing\" until a few days ago. I mean like the motivation behind it. It still doesn't have a vision in terms of the soundscape yet. Looking forward to just being open to what it arrives at. I want to make more songs like Shrouded.\r\n\r\nAnd yeah, Pelagan onwards was with the EQ fix, everything prior all the way back to Scary House was with the wrong monitoring EQ (not a flat curve), oof.\r\n\r\nEdit:\r\nAs of 10:31 PM on the 16th (very much sleep deprived today, from having stayed up; unrelated but bought 4 more Keneally releases last night, from his store, as everything is 50% off for the holidays! Had to jump on that one! So that's like at least 8 or so Keneally additions this year, wow!), Planthers' has been recorded, mixed, then re-mixed in Logic with headphone correction. The concept with this project is seemingly growing into allowing any sounds to be present. I wanted to try just using Logic Pro and my Mac for recording, to leave my old GarageBand ways behind. But I had to try this time, to make a song exactly as I would, with my OG amp, pedals, GB drums, bass guitar, all of that special combination. It's amazing how much it really makes it sound like it's from a specific era in my catalog. The sound of music I make really equates to time in my life for me. Recording like that again felt totally natural, and the whole song slipped out. The full release of just pure playing is so much easier with GB and iPad for me, seemingly. It must be a lack of DAW distraction configurations or something, I still very much enjoy it more than just recording with the Mac. The touch interface really is awesome, and not having a bunch of info in your face at once really helps keep your mind at ease when writing.\r\n\r\nMy magic connection to writing very much still seems to be rooted in improvising, active listening, and incremental writing, where repeating riffs are okay across songs, because each time you play it or arrange it, it gets better and better, hopefully more unique each time too.\r\n\r\nSo for this new song, it hopefully is the most clear audible mix of this writing style of mine. While the song itself feels like I didn't write really anything new at all, going back to the \"basics\" really does feel refreshing. I can't worry about what I am writing right now, I merely need to just write it, and move on. That's been my mantra for the last while as well, just to feel your feelings then move beyond that frame of mind, in due time. Writing seems to be the same for me too. Maybe it's because my brain is all frazzled from those remixes, and now I am kind of going back in time in writing frame of mind reference, so now I am kind of pulling from all of those parts of my catalog again. That would make a lot of sense. But what I now have come to try to follow, is that I don't need to worry about whether that is true, but to merely act as I believe things to be. If I am to choose my next set of events with that being the premise, then so be it. Whether I am wrong or right, the goal is to make up your mind, and then get to the next thing.\r\n\r\nEdit Dec 19 '25:\r\n\r\nOkay, I felt this project was going to last longer than it did. It also got more in-depth than I thought it would. It is also much more raw that I was expecting. I feel very lost as a person at the moment, and I think something is a bit off, which I mentioned before.\r\n\r\nI think I do feel a bit wary of letting this project getting too big, as I seem to be worried about that. I think I am a bit preoccupied still though, and maybe it just isn't quite the right time for music stuff. Idk. This project feels very much uninspired like duds or orange paradox. Funny that both of them were lower-cased. It kind of explains the mood I think. It's like passively wanting to be working on something, but you don't have the thing that it's rooted in. I'm glad that I made what I have so far for this, and I am glad that I am okay to share it and write about it. I do think that pushing it past what it actually is feels a bit unhealthy though. Wannafaratakow really seems to explain the feeling at the moment, and much like Carpincho, I feel like something isn't right.\r\n\r\nRight now, I feel very disconnected from everyone, and I don't know why. It's like I feel out of place with everything. I don't necessarily feel sad, I don't think. I can't tell. I just feel like nothing is mutual anymore, and it's exhausting. Things are never what they were let on to be, what you believed them to be, and the things you've relied on start to fall away. Whether it's things you connect with, things you understand. Everything just feels much more lost.\r\n\r\nThe word of the last few days/week has been \"vacuous\". Being out of people's way seems not to please them, nor yourself. Then when you stand up for yourself and do your own thing, people don't like that either. So the only reliable one seems to be the love you can have for yourself. Fostering that seems to be what helps in the long run.\r\n\r\nI am and have been wondering, and other people have mentioned to me now, that maybe I have things to look into. I thought the way I am was just \"me\", or things that I like. But maybe something is wrong. Again, it's nothing to be ashamed of, I am glad that I can do the things I can do, and maybe now I just want to understand more of why I do do the things I do. I mean, like weird stuff like all of this music seems to only make sense to me, and I don't understand why. Like the not being able to understand things, that is exactly what this music is trying to explain. And when looking at it like that, maybe there is an underlying thing in that. I have no expert knowledge in anything, but it seems to be lining up with things like ADHD, or Autism. These seem to be very big words in terms of things to describe one with, and I don't know how I've felt about that. It hadn't even really crossed my mind at all, and I haven't really related to people with those yet. But I also haven't had much exposure to understanding them yet either. But why does everyone else seem so \"normal\"? And why do I have so much disconnect with everyone else, and why do I do things differently in so many different aspects? I didn't ask for this, and it took a long time to think of it as a good thing. I don't necessarily think I thought it was a bad thing, but it always seemed like I was doing something wrong, or it was made to appear as if I was doing it on purpose or something. If I didn't have to behave in these ways, I probably wouldn't. But, I seem to not be. So, why is that? Struggles with embodying emotions, social queues with people, friends, significant others, you name it. Social anxiety is much better now, that has made significant progress. However, it seems that at the expense of that, with the confidence I do have in not feeling worried about interactions with people, now it seems from my perception that people don't get what I am putting down, if that makes sense. It's like the techniques I did discern seem to not be what other people understand, even if it does make me less anxious. For some people, it does work though.\r\n\r\nSay like asking questions from people to learn more about them. Until 2025, I did not think to do this, nor did I do it. That seems heavily significant to me. Now it seems like the obvious thing to do. Now when I don't do that, I feel rude. But I had no perception of this before. I thought people would talk about their interests until each found a place to express a commonality. So it's much less of a push-push kind of conversation stack, and more like a pull-push kind of one. This was also new to me. It explains why a lot of conversations (so many) seem to end cold back before I had realized this.\r\n\r\nI have been working on the concept of \"I\" for the last month of two as well. I seemed to have trouble accessing that, for whatever reason. Now instead of helping myself with advice in the \"you\" perspective, I work to reframe it to provide myself grounding instead. From \"Don't worry, you got this\" to \"Don't worry, I can do this\". Or \"You're fine\" to \"I'm fine\".\r\n\r\nI am also taking more internal notes about when I seem to be \"emotionally disregulated\". This has helped so much. I don't know if it's that state exactly. But when I feel \"off\", or just not in sync with myself, now I make note of that, and resolving that becomes the priority before anything else. Even if that other thing falls behind. It's okay, because it will only compound if I don't fix that. So that has been priceless for me. I seem to have to take multiple days to do this, and it involves heavy music as well. I don't want to listen to music loud because I know it's not good for your ears. But I don't know how else to let that bad energy out. It seems to give me nervous sweats too. But then I feel much more grounded. This is why I used to love my drive to work before. Now I have less time for it. But at least it's less loudness exposure.\r\n\r\nWriting like this has helped a lot as well. Whether it's just in my notebook, or in bios like this, whether public or private, whatever. And to be honest, this probably is a bit much on the info side of things, but it is how I feel, so I don't see why it's bad to make it accessible. Like, I am trying to be more vulnerable in the first place.\r\n\r\nI had the realization the other day that maybe I wasn't bullied like everyone else because I hid so much of myself from everyone. So since I did that, I didn't have anything anyone would pick on me for. This now makes me sad. I now see how not sharing more of myself to others has held me back. I now am just (and maybe it's always been the case, and I am just aware of it) sad that now there's nobody here to listen and talk with about this. I don't want solutions, I want to feel like I am understood.\r\n\r\nI don't understand myself either, and maybe that's the issue as well. The more I feel I am honing my strengths, the more that other people point out my weaknesses. I don't fucking get it. I'm fucking sick of it.\r\n\r\nI don't hold it against them either, because I understand where that's coming from. They want the best for me, and they want to make it known of things that I could work on. But man, it just is relentless.\r\n\r\nI feel disconnected from culture too, what is culture nowadays? Is there any? Where are all of the people my age at nowadays? Everyone I see is older, and does everyone else understand themselves? This is perplexing to me. Do other people believe they can accomplish the things they put their mind to? I just have to brute force my mind into doing it, whether I believe or don't believe in myself. That's the hard part.\r\n\r\nAnd when I trust my instincts, it seems like nobody believes in it. But I am told I am too mathematical and logical. But what if I base my instincts in logic and mathematical reasoning?\r\n\r\nWhy does it feel like I don't have a purpose anymore? I have purpose in the things that I have interest in, and what I care about, but why does nobody put their hand out to me? And what does it look like if I were to do that as well? Is that the issue? Am I not being open to being there for others?\r\n\r\nAnd I am not saying that everything is bad, I promise. I very much have a lot of hope. It may not seem like that (I am feeling lighthearted now 🙂), but I promise I do. Maybe that's it. I have much more perspective, it seems like there's a lot of work to be done, and I can't wait to start it. I already have! But it feels like other people are uncomfortable hearing the truth at times, as well as acknowledging it for what it is. An \"I don't know\" answer is okay, when it's true. That's how I feel. If you are using that as a crutch for being lazy and not finding it out, that's different. But using it as a descriptor for where you currently stand with your understanding, I think that's okay. It's a statement, not a foresight. Acknowledging that you don't know allows you to categorize what you need to look into next. I think that's invaluable.\r\n\r\nI think I am making this project right now because I don't have the voice to speak the strife I feel, otherwise. I am uncomfortable with that raw vulnerability, because when I explain it, it comes with critique. 'I am the issue that is causing my problems.'\r\n\r\nI don't have and never have had a life trajectory. I don't know why, and I don't like it either. I can't see the future, or rather, my future. I am at least becoming more and more aware about what I want and don't want. But I seem to be lost in the now, to where I can't be focusing on the future, because then I fall behind in the now. And I am already behind in the now.\r\n\r\nI do also acknowledge that that is just an outlook as well, and that I do have a lot of things under my belt that do put me ahead, both for my own interests and for others. I do have a lot of things to help me out of situations, much like this one, and I feel and have had a lot to teach others about hard situations as well. So I do see \"my value in the world\". It is just hard to come by consistently. I seem to always be a surprise to people in when I can be of help to them. \"You are so wise for your age\", or \"wise beyond your years\".\r\n\r\nAnd maybe this strife is just a phase again, as I have come to learn it always is. This is a hard time. I am struggling. I will get through it. I am actively getting through it. I will, and am, finding answers to get out of it. There will be more struggles, questions, and answers.\r\n\r\nI *will* continue to strive for what makes me happy, as that is the only thing that seems to keep me sane, whatever that means. I also will continue fostering an open mind. I will continue living my feelings, to the extent that I do.\r\n\r\nI love you, take care of yourself. (this is to me, and the reader)\r\n\r\nEdit Dec 20, the morning:\r\n\r\nI don't want to discount the people and times that have been there for me, as this was definitely present too. I think right now I just have been lacking in it. I think I am concerned with my ability/access to foster new relationships with people where this is present, this is my fear I think. The people I am close with, it is getting better and better in the relationship. I am very thankful for that, and we are growing together because of it. There are still hiccups of course, and that's okay. I think I just am feeling low at the moment. And again, it's okay. I think the next step is to continue connecting with people, as I very much want to connect with people on a personal level.\r\n\r\nEdit 1:32 AM, Dec 21:\r\n\r\nSecond night working on mastering. Last night I also made the track ordering, as the listing of songs is now different than I wrote them in. Some of the demo songs were omitted as well, in hopes of making this at least an interesting listen. While totally weird and unexplainable, at least it seems like you don't get bored. At least the songs that I was bored with, I omitted those. This album is very much inspired by the experimental side of things, and I don't think it was necessarily intentional. Just been listening to Captain Beefheart, Zappa, and Keneally over the last few months, so that's probably why this resulted in the way it sounds. Of course caused by all of the other life events too. So lots of factors at play. Now I am happy with this release, now that I can look at it as a \"thing\". May even make some Kunaki CDs with it. Oh, and forgot to mention Mr. Bungle and Maggot Twat as influences one way or another as well. Can't leave out Time of Orchids either. Or the \"debut\" Porcupine Tree album. Love me some Linton Samuel Dawson (the song, not the drogas). Nor can I leave out the classic references like Marco Minnemann's epic catalog. Sandwich!\r\n\r\nThis is essentially the first release with seemingly \"proper\" headphone EQ correction too, let me know if things are much of an improvement. It seems much more clear to me. I haven't listened to the masters in the car yet, usually that's a good tell right off the bat, if things are consistent or not. The mixes for some songs were pre-EQ correction, but all of the masters were at least with correction. It was just because I had mixed them before I fixed and learned about the EQ correction, and it felt disingenuous to go back and try to fix what was already there. As you can tell with this album, I would rather keep moving forward and make a new song(s) than try to fix older ones. Been doing that plenty as of recently. Needed to let the creative reins take over again!\r\n\r\nThis project turned out much more like I was hoping it would, than I thought it could have. The goal was to merely go back to the free-minded, open-ended attempts at just writing whatever. The challenge this time, was being able to somehow make it into a single cohesive thing. While the statements are all over the board, I think in some unexplainable way, it very much works awesome together. The songs compliment each other very well I think, and trying to do that when writing them would have not been possible. Having new ears to pick and sort what you like, and to rearrange into what is a telling dynamic, I think that can hold a lot of power. So the songs were very much open-ended in the creative moment of them, and I was thankfully able to let go of songs that I felt were part of the process, but weren't \"listenable\", or \"didn't have a certain statement\". Sometimes there are songs I like, but in concept, not in listening. I am happy with the threshold I set for this one. It seemed to filter just as needed.\r\n\r\nThe writing for some of these started in mid-early November, and is now concluding mid-late December. I only knew I was making this about a week or so ago. So it is in practice, a collection of demos that didn't have a cohesive thing. But yes, this is how I used to write, and now for the \"first time\", it is trimmed down to the essentials. The statements. The landscapes, the observations. The vegetables. It probably could have used more vegetables, but that's okay, haha.",

        "about": "I think I have figured out how to articulate emotional disregulation. I didn't know that this sound is that, but yes, it is that. This album is seemingly allowing me to reconnect with that again, either to learn about it, or something like that. I am trying to discern why I am doing this, it seems like it is on a fine line right now of being something not constructive. I think I am finding out how to make it constructive though. There is something to learn from this, and I don't want to shy away from it.\n\nThis song was made after a stressful work day, much like the ones back in 2023, which was plentiful back then, looking back now. I think my new mindsets and environments lend themselves better to not having these kinds of days as much. And when I do have days like this, I now know and am cognizant of it, and it doesn't take hold of me. I get into spirals of feeling like I have lost control, and that I don't have a positive outlook on my situation or myself. That is not present anymore, or rather, when those things do come up in my mind, I see them merely as that, thoughts. They are not the truth. I am merely just disregulated from whatever is bothering me, and that's okay. I feel like this, and that's that. What am I going to do about it? It's not \"me\", so I don't need to treat it like it is. I also don't want to give any more power to these thoughts. I absolutely want to shed light on them though, as it does feel like it removes their power, and it allows me to see them for what they are. I feel much much better to work through them, and use them for positive growth. I am utilizing that to do this with this album. Why does so much \"not make sense\"? Why do I always ask so many questions?\n\nI learned today about \"normative, informative, and generative voices\". It seems like a lot of my struggles tend to be around normative concepts. I seem to very much be rooted in finding answers to things, as that will provide me with the internal security to believe in the thing I am being persuaded to agree with, look into, etc. If I am to be convinced of something, I need facts, logic, and reasoning. I don't tend to trust my own instincts first, so if I am to be on the side of your instincts, then I need lots of reasoning. I need lots of reasoning to explain to myself as to why to decide certain things, so that seems to be why I ask that of others as well.\n\nI think that's why music [creation] has been such a monumental shift for me, because it is essentially the antithesis to how I operate, and I have to let myself trust myself and my instincts. If I don't, then this doesn't work at all. Logically, if I were to use my logic and reasoning for my music, on paper, none of this makes any sense. But depending on what the viewpoint is, it really does. In relation to how it makes me feel, and what it now has provided to me on a personal level, this is monumental, priceless. My logic and reasoning wouldn't have allowed for any of this to exist, because it's just too ridiculous. But in lew of setting that aside, and trusting what it is that makes me happy, then, here we are. I have to learn from what opportunities I do have, right now, rather than the hypothetical ones that I think I would want. So maybe it loops back around in an odd way. Because I don't trust in possibilities of the future, because they \"make sense\", at least I can trust in the things that don't \"make sense\" in the present, because at least they are tangible, something I have oversight over, I can track progress, and I have the ability to move it in the directions I want to. If these projects are to be known by the greater public (lol what), then I have the ability to do that. I don't have control of how the job market accepts people, based on their schooling. Degrees might not get jobs anymore, so it seems (generalizations). So I feel more enticed to put energy into things that I can visibly see are being positive for my growth and future. I don't want a hypothetical future, I want the future to be now. I've had enough of others' pushing things off, and that includes me. If I don't want to do something now, what makes me think I will want to do it in the future? There's a difference between not being able to do something now, versus it not being the right decision for you. Learning about myself was the best thing I could have done for myself at this point in my life, and I hope that many other people can do the same for themselves and their struggles. It's like how people say that you don't know what you don't know. I certainly didn't!\n\nPlease, just fart more! And make more fart jokes.\n\nHad to end it on a high note. ..?",

    "about": "Nov. 20 '25\r\n\r\nYou betcha, that's right! Elkosaurus Tex is soon to be rereleased in full lossless quality! This is a great step up from the original, as I really didn't know what I was doing while I was making it. I still don't know what I'm doing, but that's besides the point. All of the projects were re-bounced in Logic Pro instead of GarageBand, and all of the gain staging issues are to be fixed. Everything is going to be mastered as well, so nicer volume consistency, and no ear-rattling 3khz tones that could kill. They're the death of me at least. No more, no more! Okay; oh and yeah! Possibly possibly expect a full CD release as well. Just heard about Kunaki, and having this on a proper physical release (alongside Recreational Outrage) would complete a huge life goal for me. Not even complete, but moreso just that having that is something that I am and will be very proud and happy to have. It's representative of how far the work has come, and how much I have learned over the last few years. Music has really helped me learn more about myself, more than you could ever know. It's awesome. Can't wait to see what you think of this, now that it is in a way, closer to how it actually sounded when I made it, compared to how it turned out when I had released it. And yes, the artwork is now 3x more resolution. Just, because. This project is even more over the top than it was to start with. And because of this, it's probably not too far-fetched to eventually release it on all platforms too. I think I didn't start with this one because I knew I was going to want to rehash it to make the quality clearer than how it was firstly.\r\n\r\nHappy Holidays! Remember to be with family, great memories find their way into your life, and you will remember them forever and ever ❤️\r\n\r\nP.S.\r\nOh yeah, and I have already started work on the HARRY remaster/remix project. That one is going to be a faithful remix to the original, unlike the remix for 'so, many, bad, decisions'. I have most of it done, did most of the setup and EQ fixes probably about 3 weeks ago. Haven't felt the connection to it for a bit though, so I didn't want to force myself to work on it just because it needs to get done. I very much love that project, and I want to work on it when I have open ears for it. That's more the thing. And when you listen to something a lot, you kind of lose your precision with it. Not that Elkosaurus isn't something I care about, far from opposite. I just felt that 'drive' to work on it, and I had the feeling it was going to be less intensive to work on, as this one is kind of meant to sound bad. I mean, there are parts that I did want to clean up, like the fact that the original bounces weren't even lossless, and in general, just apply some EQ and maybe maybe, compression on the master bus. The limiting and gain staging issues, along with lossless, were the main things I wanted to bring to this project. It is also seeming like the quality of instrument rendering in Logic is much better than GarageBand iOS too, which I can't tell if it's the Mandela effect, but comparing the two, they sound much much better. Not sure what that's about. So yes, some synths will sound less \"low-budget\" than on the original. Again, I can't quite tell if that was just the original bounce, or if it's the synths themselves, but something sounds much clearer. I haven't even done the mastering parts yet either. That will only help even moreso.\r\n\r\nI also am working out how I will make this work for CD, in the proper form. I have one CD I made from the original version that had to cut 5 or 7 minutes off because the album is 1:24 in length. I will have to do that somehow here too. Will decide if there are songs I can cut, or merely creatively merge together or something? The lineup for these songs is much clearer for me too, I am less swayed by the \"complete\" picture of all of these now, albeit back then I still totally see why I did that. If I do end up dramatically changing the list of songs, I think it will be a separate release, intentionally a different \"view\" at this time period. It would be a companion release, merely just a change of song order or something, and likely to include \"Infinitrack\". That is really the only one that might make sense on this album. And it's already too long, and some songs are a bit lackluster. So, separate to this remaster, yeah, I might entertain the idea of making that. It might include some of the demo artwork that didn't get used for this final project too, as there are two or three other variations I didn't go with. One has a flag overlay (Texas), and one is at night. There were some demo fonts I didn't use too, both for the title and artist name. I did like all of them, I ended up with this artwork because I felt it matched the feeling of the album. A fine line of confusing, streamlined, and aesthetic. The other two variations were just more wild. I felt this album had more nuance than just pure chaos. That mightbewhy Corruption Junction iswild.\r\n\r\nNov 30 '25\r\n\r\nWow, finished up the final few adjustments for mastering the last maybe 9 tracks. Listening back, as I add these files to the listing here on Bandcamp, I am blown away. I loved this album because it was something that amused me. I thought it was purely just silly. But now I can hear it in full quality (ah hah, aaahh), I mean in the metaphorical sense. Because the project was littered with gain staging and lack of EQ and mastering, the original outcome of the project was hidden under layers of cruft, and hearing it as clear as it's ever been, it's never been any more obvious what was going on with it. I am taken aback. It's not as ridiculous as I ended up making it out to be. If anything, Recreational is miles into space compared to Elkosaurus. Elkosaurus is very much an across the board release. There are a lot more styles and references in here than I originally remembered. It seems like this was essentially the crossroads of so much that came before, whether it be musical inspirations, or my own interests in general. It ended up foreshadowing some other ones as well. This is very Zappa and or Keneally sounding as well. I think I had just started listening to Keneally at that point, I can't totally recall I know it was around the same time period for sure, but I am trying to recall what parts of the album were during when I had gotten into his work. I think Sluggo absolutely makes an appearance as an inspiration, whether intentional or not.\r\n\r\nBus Blues is a Marco/Aristocrats funny thing. Cry on Weastward Sun has a bunch of Marco references I think. The cattle duo, at least that I can recall, had nothing to do with the songs on hat. I hadn't listened to that album yet. So it was seemingly by coincidence. Amusing. Cheesecake has Marco drumming references as well. I absolutely love Gunk. I forget about that that song isn't just goofiness, it's actually pretty proggy, I think? Solo-ish? Cliff's Edge View foreshadows my interest in Devin and reverb kind of things; I hadn't crossed paths with him yet. Liminal Spaces is (now in hindsight) obviously inspired by early Porcupine Tree. I think around this time was Up the Downstair if I remember right. Bacon is a Guthrie-inspired song. I think this was inspired by the live version of Erotic Cakes, in San Pedro. Hornets is seemingly related to 'Party with the Termites' on Marco's album Symbolic Fox. Huge inspiration for me, that album got me into his catalog. That was back in fall of 2019. So that was kind of the initial start to the intro to prog in my own vein. I think Donuts was Aristocratic as well. DJFLUTES was a djent take at flutes, apparently lol. Laundromat was seemingly maybe inspired by 'Looking for Nina' from Sluggo!, not totally sure. Do and did dig that song a ton, and it was probably spinning in my head at the time of making this part of the album. Cab Crossing was seemingly a one-off Steely Dan kind of song. Didn't know I was going to make it, didn't know I even could make it. Have always been very happy with the result of that one. Sunset was in part inspired by Marco's writing. I think it was something like on My Sister maybe, another 2019 obsession of mine. It is probably a bunch of different Marcoisms to be honest, not sure quite which album it was. The big part of influence for this album was trying to write around the drums, as I really liked the idea of how Marco did that. Might have to start doing that again nowadays, kind of got into a rut with it, and ended up trying so many other different things, didn't come back to it as much yet.\r\n\r\nI didn't necessarily want to change the track list, but I want to release this on CD, so I will have to trim and or omit some songs. My current CD for the old version omitted 24 and 25, as they felt a bit slow in that part of the album. Now I think they really make a lot of sense in the running order. I think this time I will make the first few songs into digital-only bonus tracks, as they are crucial to the completeness of this project, yet I do think they kind of make the start of the album go off to a rocky start. I know it was meant to be the \"worst\" album ever, but I actually think it didn't end up being that at all. And again, as I have mentioned elsewhere, I don't think that is even possible, I now understand. It's just as impossible to make the worst album ever as it is to make the best album ever. Life is a beauty aint it??\r\n\r\nListening to Chungus at the moment. Should that be the start to the album afterall? Hmm, we shall see. I'm actually not totally sure. I kind of like that it makes the end of the album into a seemingly silly and happy statement too though, so it may stay it's home there. Might remove the Overture part? That was because I wanted it to start the album, yet it didn't feel like it should start the album, lol. And naming it overture and placing it at the end felt like a nice way to aid in making this the worst album ever lol.\r\n\r\nThis version sounds much better than it needs to, to be honest. Again, I am kind of shocked. Gain staging, EQ, light compression, that's it. Oh, and lossless bounces. And, but not intentionally, rendered with Logic Pro instruments rather than GarageBand iOS (in most spots), merely just because of the merit of using Logic. If I could have used 1:1 synths, I probably would have. I think it does sound \"better\" now though, not totally sure if it's actually better samples, or if it's just because it's lossless now. Interesting things. The rendering definitely has changed over time for some synths though, that's for certain. Not much of Elkosaurus seemed effected thankfully though, maybe only a few here and there. Some of my other projects though? Whooh boy, those aren't coming back in lossless, it's sadly not possible (Septem Numero 😢).\r\n\r\nLet me know if you would like a physical copy 😜\r\n\r\nBrandon Bennett\r\n\r\nEdit: the phrase \"Elkosaurus Tex, it has no business sounding as good as it does\" 😂\r\n\r\nDec 4 '25\r\n\r\nOkay, as of 12:39 AM, this remix is now public!\r\n\r\nComing back a few days since doing the mastering and such, I found out about and or remembered that I need to look into EQ for system output with my headphones. It seems like my mixes are definitely running a bit hot with bass and treble, because it's what counteracts the output of my Sony MDR-7506's. I don't want to worry about this remix more, again, though, so I am going to leave it as-is. This is once again, a large improvement overall, so that's at least somewhere to start. Who knows, maybe I will remix this again, and do a proper mastering job lol. The fact that this is now no longer lossy, and improperly gain-staged, that's great. That's the biggest part of why this was done again.\r\n\r\nNote that while it's called a remix, I didn't actually do any remixing this time around. Merely because of how the projects were saved though, I had to re-render them with Logic Pro, and that seemed to produce some different synth patch sounds to some extent, be it just higher-quality samples, or updates to the Sound Library in GB/LP over the last four years. So I do hypothetically want to do a proper mix for this project, as it hasn't actually ever received one, literally speaking. I didn't even \"mix\" in the proper sense on the first go-around. I just recorded, and bounced (literally, and literally, lol). So a lot of the production for this was merely during mastering. In the last 48 hours I started brushing up on the need to use EQ fixes for my headphones, as well as multiband compression. Both of which seem to be what I am looking for in terms of various struggles I've run into for production, I just didn't know of or how to use such tools to fix such issues. You also have to know about the issues before you are able to solve them. That's the hardest part, in my opinion! How many things go under the radar merely because of your lack of awareness of them, it's very interesting.\r\n\r\nOkay, about the track listing. I didn't want to break up this album in terms of song ordering. But I do want to release this on CD, with Kunaki. Elkosaurus was running up to 1 hour and 24 minutes. So I had to find at least 4 minutes to trim off of the running length to make it fit. I flirted with the concept of speeding up certain songs to make them fit in the duration, even if it was just done with the tongue in cheek literal silliness of that. But I am \"too lazy\" for that, and the album is a bit more congruent with these songs left as bonus tracks as well. I still love them, and this is probably counter to the idea of how obtuse Elkosaurus was intended to be. But, in being open to just being okay with what decisions I make, I think this is actually an okay choice. I wouldn't want to edit Elkosaurus to make it into something it's not, anyways. The foresight to change the album these many years later, I don't like that. But it has to be done because of these new constraints. So in trying to keep the most amount of Elkosaurus as accurate as possible to the original, I think not editing it is the way to go. Trimming it with exclusive titles, that seems a little more straightforward to me. It's less of a creative decision for why I am doing it anyways, so I don't think a \"creative\" solution is necessarily the applicable choice in this case. The songs are very much still intentional with the lineup, I just won't be able to include them on the CD. Think of them as like the secret stories between the folds of the book. It's in there, you just need special access to get to them (what?). I don't have a good analogy for this. But yeah, I didn't want to trim the album. But I have to, and I am letting myself be okay with trimming it. Having it on CD is too cool.\r\n\r\nAnd yes, eventually, just maybe, there could be a vinyl release of this. It likely would be a very much trimmed track list as well, merely the \"essential\" or \"best of\" setlist of the project. I don't like compilation albums, don't worry it's not that. It would just be \"the essence of Elkosaurus\". Whatever logic works to explain why Elkosaurus could be on vinyl, and it not spend a fortune, then I'm sold. The meme is too strong with this one. I have to see it through whether I like it or not. THIS TOO SHALL PASS!!!\r\n\r\nGoing to start working on the remix for Carpincho soon too. I still need to finish up the mastering for the new HARRY remix as well. That one is nearly done. Along with those on the horizon, I will add a digital booklet here for the soon to be created artwork for the CD release. And in the event vinyl is released, the artwork for that will probably be added here too.\r\n\r\nCheers, and farts to space, hope you stink up the place!\r\n\r\nJust made that up. Maybe I can start scatting lyrics now.\r\nBrandon :)\r\n\r\nAnd yeah, again, this is not a real re'mix', merely a rerender, and a remaster. And since it's not coming from the original mixdown sources, I felt disingenuous to call it a remaster. Same with going from lossy to lossless, that would have to imply a new bounce, as it is in the first place.\r\n\r\nEdit, 1:33 AM\r\n\r\nDecided to actually mix things up. The original artwork upscaled, it looks great. I do think I did kind of step back a bit from the original concept I had drafted when making it (I think that was in 2022?). I think the craziness of the artwork was seemingly a bit too big of a statement for me at the time. It looked *too* out there for what I was comfortable with at the time. Now I actually really like it, and it's not even that weird, compared to things I've released since then. So I will make the \"original\" unforeseen artwork the proper one for this release. It will also come with the benefit of more easily distinguishing against the original too. I will include both in the download. There is a night-themed color scheme one too, I might use that for the back of the CD or something, maybe. We'll see (as I always seem to say). But yeah, this is really the first draft of the original artwork, before I nerfed it a bit. It looks great in full resolution. I had to vectorize the Texas flag, it was relatively pixelated otherwise. Note the interesting font similarity to Carpincho. This actually went the other way, than you might think. Since this was the OG artwork, I liked the Carpincho font because of this unused version of Elkosaurus. So it was kind of a nod to that, even with it not having been made readily available from this project. So it was like a secret back-reference to this. I also just plain like the font, and think it describes the aesthetic very nicely. Can't wait to see this on CD and or vinyl. Part of me wants to see both versions on both physical copies. So maybe I will merely just make the back of the CD into the OG artwork. The inside liner notes/track list could use the night theme one I mentioned. Not sure how I'd handle the vinyl cover.\r\n\r\nI think I didn't use this artwork because it also felt kind of distracting and busy. But that kind of describes the album too though, lol. So now I think it's very fitting, and always has been. I think the sound of the album now matches the chaos of the artwork. But yeah, again, to clarify, I didn't choose the font because it was on Carpincho, I chose this font when I made this artwork in 2022, and Carpincho used it in result of that, and because I just like the font and how it communicates the album(s).\r\n\r\nEdit 2:06 AM\r\n\r\nReverted the Digital Bonus track concept. This album is too cohesive to what it has been. I can't remove them. The CD will have to be the outlier. The digital copy is the exact same, I can't omit them just for the CD. Maybe if I release this to all of the services and platforms, I will keep everything, and for CD and vinyl, I will have a smaller track list. Maybe? I'm not totally sure. I don't know how I will be able to trim down this project and keep all of it's nuance intact. It may have to stay digital-only or something. I don't know. I want to make physical copies, but the album is too gosh darned long!! lol",

    "about": "A very confusing album, representative of a very confusing and turbulent time.\r\n\r\nThe following rant was from when I published some of the first songs of this, on Nov 7th. This little preface is from when I finished bouncing the final files on the evening of the 9th. This album took all of about, well, say, two or three days of work. Maybe four. Some songs were just trying to do some sort of recording again, last week. Then with everything being in flux, I ended up feeling this should be a collection of statements. I will further elaborate with time. As you were:\r\n\r\nI keep wanting to make a better album, I feel like I know more and more about what makes a great album. But I know less and less about how to play instruments, and to actually make the album itself. The more I learn, the more out of touch with my own abilities I feel. I keep trying to make a better set of songs, and I keep coming back to the same shit. I want to play with other musicians, but nobody seems interested or receptive to my work. I also don't seem to have the guts to want to share my work to get real criticism. I am mad that I don't know what I really want, and I am mad that I can't even be good at being bad, anymore. I know it's the time period of things in the pipeline, but goddamn. Right now fricking sucks. I want to write lyrics to describe how I feel, but I am to afraid to speak, and I don't know if I really know how to. Why do I have to be so analytical all of the time? Do people really care what I think? Why does everything I have to do have to be because of my own interests? Why does nobody care about anyone else? It's not even about waiting for other people to ask me to jam with them. It's people ghosting me for meeting up to make things. How many people out there are also sick of their own personal bullshit? What do you do to handle that?\r\n\r\nWhy is everyone so self-absorbed into their phones all of the time? Doesn't anyone else strive to want to learn about others? What the fuck? I mean, what's so important about what is on the next flick of your finger when scrolling the endless web of AI crap that is now the Internet? Why is everything so fucked? Everyone has stickers about people they hate. What music do you like? What's your favorite color? I don't care that you hate everyone else. So does everyone else, that's not unique to you. Fuck off. I hate hating this about others, because that's exactly what I am hating about what they are doing. I hate that I am hating. Please, please, can we just be real?\r\n\r\nI don't know what this album is, and I also can't make it into something it's not. I am confused, frustrated, alone, sad, grieving, lost, grateful, thankful, uninspired, hopeful, insecure, and driven. I don't know where this is going, but I can't keep feeling this ugly. I don't want to keep feeling this ugly.\r\n\r\nEdit Nov. 10 '25: When printing the original artwork for my personal copy of the project (I make jewel cases with CD-Rs inside of my catalog, as I make it), the printer seemingly ran out of ink, because of just how much red the artwork needed. I was bummed about this, but also, I was kind of fine with it. It's like it represented that the intensity of what this record came from, it's like it was \"melting the printer\" in that it was too intense to print the artwork, because of what it was rooted in. I know it's just the printer running out of ink, that's the logical answer. It also however represented a reflection of how I am and have been feeling because of everything going on, and how I internally feel like I am falling apart. So it was an accurate reflection of that as well. I think I took it as more of a happy accident than an intentional thing. I was indeed curious about whether there was enough ink when printing it, and I never would have thought it to look like how it turned out. The whole image is supposed to be red essentially. So you'd think there would be no red if the ink was totally out. But there was just enough to try, and then it gave in. It couldn't let the intensity take over. That's a sign of strength. I printed the artwork on cardstock, because I thought I might make a booklet out of it. But since I didn't want to waste the extra think paper, I printed the artwork sideways, so I could fold the rest of the paper into the two-fold thing. There's only two parts to it. So that's why I wrote on it as well, and why the lines of the ink go that direction. Had I printed it normal, vertically, the red would have printed from the top of the artwork, not the right. Very intriguing, and also, very fascinating.\r\n\r\nEdit about probably an hour later:\r\nThought that an inverted color version of the new artwork would look cool. Tried it, super cool. Then I had the inclination, to combine the two in some aspect. That turned out even even cooler, awesome. It is very much more unhinged now. So many layers went into the artwork, I couldn't have done it intentionally, if I tried. It's just inclination after inclination, after mishap, after inclination, and so on. Very happy with how it turned out, and how accurate it represents the void feeling of the work, and inherently the time period that it originated from.",

Then more is stacked on top. You can't deal with the first stuff. Then more gets piled on that. Then you find out that you haven't learned how to deal with it, and that's why it got piled onto. The only way out is through. Being alone emotionally, and realizing that your independence is a weakness. You then start to lose people you look up to. Now who do you turn to? You are the person that others look up to now. What the fuck now? I can only be positive in the face of it, because there's not really a point in being anything else. I don't know how to be sad, so I just keep doing what I know how to do, which is dealing with things on my own. It's fucked. But it's what I got. So lets go face this. Fuck it.",

        "about": "Making use of what I've been learning from doing the stem remixes. Automation by riding the faders throughout the song. I've done manual automation a set of times up until now, but riding the faders is both much easier to do, and more natural. You can just record in the volume change needs as you hear them, rather than having to listen back, add the manual fade spots, all of that. It's very neat. It seems like EQ, compression, and automation, they are doing wonders for my work. Much clearer mixes. And of course, master bus work too, being intentional compression, gain staging, EQ, limiting, all of that stuff. Limiting individual tracks before sending them to the master bus really helps too, that one I picked up somewhere, and only have had to use if frequently, but it surefire helps.\n\nHad an energy bar just before writing this. For some reason the cookies and cream flavor makes my breath taste like the smell of a farm. Hence the name of the song, it was the working title. I wanted to come up with a proper title, but I can't think of any off of the top of my head, and the one I did think of, while mixing, I forgot what it was. So, well, I guess this is the name for now, \"horsefarmbreath\".",

    "about": "Heya! This is on Nov. 15, '25. Coming back to write up about this project. Had some thoughts and things to describe about this update to it, and maybe the reconnection to the musings of the original heart that it came from.\r\n\r\nThis project was very much, at least in feeling for myself, \"my first album\". I had made plenty of original songs up to this point, but I didn't internally feel like they were part of a cohesive vision (most of the songs on the 'Classic Projects' compilation album are what I am referencing). I also wasn't necessarily making what I had been wanting to make. I mean, I found out how to make songs, but I didn't have that feeling of \"yes\". To some extent, I guess that's always the case with my projects, and it just ends up being what I am capable of making at that time period. I am okay with that, and now I think that is actually the visible goal for myself, as of today, right now, and what I perceive to be going forwards into the future. I am to be as clear to make what I feel I need to make at that moment, and I am to do it as good as I can do it. I am to learn what I need to work on to make that vision clearer if I wasn't able to do what I wanted to do in my head.\r\n\r\nOkay, that is laid out now. In learning how much a mix or master can affect a creative work, I was very curious about this as a concept. Lots of my work felt like it was completely there creatively, but it's coat of paint or foundation was merely just incomplete, or I wasn't able to articulate it effectively, or just didn't know how to for what I was hoping to achieve. This makes a lot of sense now. So now with that concept, I recently have been going into my back catalog to assess what I felt didn't work with it, from that time. I started with remixing 'so, many, bad, decisions', as I felt that I maybe could have a new set of ears at hearing it different than it was to start with. It originally was going to try to be a faithful remix to the original, but then I let the rains down a bit, and let it be what it was going to be, whether that was a creative new take a the original one, or if it was simply just a hope to adjust the \"paint\" of it to bring it's light through a bit better. I am happy with what I was able to do for that. I do find now though that I do think it did change the feeling of the album a bit, and I don't necessarily like that. I am happy with the result of the new feeling though, so I am utilizing that as being a success. I tried something new, learned from it, and I got a new way to hear a project I am close to and already love. It did clean up some loose ends of things I didn't like about the first, so it was still a success in a list of hopes of what I wanted to achieve with the remix.\r\n\r\nCome to this remaster. This was a very open project (the original I mean, in terms of writing, composition, creation, learning), and I always loved how it turned out. Looking back now though, it was littered with the issues of my lack of knowledge in making it. Again, I wouldn't have known any better, and it's not a bad thing. I am where I am now because of the mistakes I've made along the way. That's how the learning happened.\r\n\r\nSo. The album came out in 2016. I had bounced the songs straight to M4A for use in iTunes, as that was essentially the only \"target\" I was worried about. I was making an album for myself, and to \"maybe\" play for my friends over a speaker or something. It was to see what was possible. I thought it was just crazy at all that I could create a song in GarageBand, export it, save it to my computer, add my name to it, and add it to my phone. I felt like a \"professional\". Not that I actually believed that, but I think I had assumed there was more music to it than just that, and that was very intriguing to me. This idea started with back in 'Made in merica' essentially. That was the first proper album, for real. I was curious not just about making cool songs (the 'Classic Projects' demos), but the idea of a \"thing\" that had a whole world in it, and it was \"mine\" (huh?), that seemed amazing. Like I could just make any sounds I wanted to, and if I liked it, then just put a cool picture on it, make some cool names to describe what I thought that song sounded like, and call it a day. The experimenting essentially started with this album, in the literal sense. The first two projects were in all reality, me learning how to use GarageBand, and getting used to the production process. The \"album\" part was the cool part, and that it was all one long story. I tried to do song transitions, but I didn't know how to do that, so I didn't do it very well. That aside, having one long group of \"sonic stories\" and ways to describe whatever \"atmosphere\" this was, I loved that. It seemed very personal. I wasn't conscious of all this stuff, but this is how I am remembering it feeling now, looking back on it, with the words I understand from it now.\r\n\r\nSo yeah. For this project, I have no idea about the (im)proper use of gain staging. I didn't know about EQ, compression, \"mixing\" in the proper sense. I just could make sounds that I enjoyed or seemed new to my ears, combine them, and give names to their tone. I wasn't even necessarily happy with the \"imperfections\" of things like the weird time signatures or \"happy mistakes\". I just didn't know how to fix them, and dealing with all of that in GarageBand is heinous (looking back now) anyways, so I kind of just learned to love the songs as they were.\r\n\r\nThen you come back to the things like quirks with GarageBand audio rendering, and plain things like updates that change synth sounds over time. So now if I open the songs today in GarageBand iOS, they likely sound totally different, because the songs were rendered with buggy (probably?) synths, and now they don't sound like the original takes anymore. And because I didn't see the need for Bounce in Place, nor is it trivial in GarageBand iOS, the real stems don't actually exist anywhere; other than the audio samples I made myself of course.\r\n\r\nAnd to make matters even more complicated. Since I was heavily trying to essentially push the limits of what I seemed to be an endless playground of things to build and create with, a lot of the things I would play with these synths and samples seemingly didn't play nicely with, what I now see, was GarageBand's Offline rendering mode. So I would make a song like \"1eve1 I\", and the way it sounds now in the bounce, it didn't sound anything like that when I had recorded it. It was without that weird note that spans the whole length of the track. It was much more open in that part of the song, in that you could actually hear the parts where that part obscures. The vocal part was meant to sound all chopped up and DJ-like in a way, or something like that. \"glitchy\", in sound.\r\n\r\nI got so frustrated and confused as to why the song wasn't exporting the same as it had intended to sound, that I ended up deleting the `.band` file for it, and now only that messed up M4A one is what remains from it. This is the same thing for Gamma Rays as well. I actually don't totally remember what the intended one of that was supposed to sound like, I think the ending craziness on the copy that remains was much more fuzzy and louder than the playback sound of the original.\r\n\r\nHad I somehow had the ability to export these with Realtime bouncing back then, maybe this wouldn't have been an issue. But I didn't know this was a facet to the issue at play, nor was it available to me in GarageBand iOS, which was all I had or understood how to use. We didn't have any Macs, nor Logic Pro X (nice), so there were a lot of factors at play at being able to actually fix the songs to be what I made them sound like originally. And now I definitely can't fix it, because of my frustration which led me to delete the `.band` files. And they probably wouldn't playback or render the same as back then anyways, hence because of all the things I mentioned earlier.\r\n\r\nSo, that's where we stand with things. Then you have small little things that bugged me, which again, weren't intentional. After having \"finished\" the album sometime during the summer (I think?), I ended up making another song, \"Conspiracy\". I felt like the album had a proper end with the end of Cascade. I really did want the album to end there. But then Conspiracy was such a great track, I thought I may add it on to the end. Looking at it now, I could have done just that, but I still don't want it to end on *such* a dark note. I 100% love the darkness of that song though, so it was definitely needed for inclusion in the project. It was almost going to be added to Spectrum, like a cool seamless transition between albums. I forgot about that, maybe I will look into doing that again, I don't think I actually have tried that yet before, other than having to want to do it maybe with this song. But Spectrum didn't end up including this song, and it was just a bonus track here instead. \r\n\r\nWhy is all of this significant? Okay. Remember how we had only bounced the tracks with M4A? yeah. How are we to do song transitions now then? So, I had (badly) attempted to cut off part of the end of Cascade, and paste it into the start of Conspiracy. That involved trimming the already-bounced Cascade with the now shorter ending, now once again, back to M4A. This was getting ugly. I thought that I wouldn't need to do this, so that's why I didn't account for it really when bouncing to M4A, from the beginning. Now it is trivial when bouncing to lossless, because you don't worry about lossy encodes each time. And all of the other implications I mentioned prior to now. And because I had bounced Conspiracy with the start including the end of Cascade, now there was no going back, because seemingly that one seemed to bounce differently with each export as well, so I couldn't go back and remove that extra clip I had added. I just gave up on including Conspiracy at that point, so for the time until this was uploaded to Bandcamp the first time, it didn't actually have any bonus tracks in my own library. It was some time after I had uploaded it to Bandcamp that I added the three tracks just as they were, even with their brokenness, to the original Bandcamp version.\r\n\r\nOkay, now where are we? In seeing that this project had no viable way to \"fix\" the project using it's stems or a rebounce to proper lossless (sad face emoji), the only possible way I could do \"anything\" to \"help\" this project was to attempt a remaster of it. How bad could that be? I think it very much turned out very nicely for it. Lots of the rough edges of simple things like EQ and volume consistency between tracks, that's much simpler to handle in a more accessible interface like Logic. So the production was mainly the only thing I could fix. The sources are ugly, so be it. I am happy now with the story that they hold, too. So I don't mind embracing them for what they are and were, essentially. So I think it wraps around nicely here.\r\n\r\nAnd I simply used ffmpeg to convert the \"source M4A files\" (ugh, I'm sorry!) into WAV files (travesty!), and remaster those. I did a lot of things like cutting certain frequencies which hurt to listen to, as I didn't know about the know how about that before, nor did I really understand any of that stuff. I just knew it \"sounded bad\", \"unfinished\", \"uneven\", \"hurt\", or was \"too loud\". So I knew it needed work, but I didn't know what was wrong with it in the technical sense, nor did I know how to fix it. And inherently, I didn't know any better to leave room for my future self to fix it, because for whatever reason.\r\n\r\nOkay. And big takeaways from all of that? I never delete any songs I make anymore. Any. Not that it's a strict rule, as I mean, I do delete random things if I didn't like them or something, but that would have to be very very early on. Even if something doesn't make the cut for an album now, I still don't delete it. It just goes in an \"Extras\" folder inside of that project. The information of holding on to the knowledge of something I made that I don't like, that's just as useful as something I did like, or was happy with. It just doesn't warrant being part of the complete project, on a visible level. The creativity in it still left it's mark though, so I shall keep the demo. That's the thing.\r\n\r\nAnd starting with Flatlands, I always bounce in lossless. Yes, that's right. Elkosaurus is sourced from M4A files. I am bummed about that too. I may, and just maybe, try to go back and do a proper remix from the original `.band` files, as I love that project for what it is. And I am curious about the gain staging, EQ, and compression issues that might have been at play. I haven't even gone back and listened to that project with those things in mind though, so I am very curious what my takeaways will be in terms of this \"new ear\" of mine, per se. Yes it was meant to be an ugly album, purely bad. But one part of the equation I never did complete, was the concept that it would be *even more hilarious* if I were to bounce the whole thing as lossless (as back then I wasn't actually able to hear lossless being any different, I just saw it as \"unnecessary\". Oh how I was wrong), and mix and master it to be very well done. So like a nice and shiny turd, for lack of better words. Best way to meme, ever. So yeah. Maybe remastering (or remixing!!! 🤓) a turd into a better turd, that's pretty hilarious as well. I have never thought about that in the terms of Elkosaurus ambiguity. That's funny. Making a mental note of that. You may see a rehashed version of Elkosaurus in the near future. Will keep you up to date. Ha.\r\n\r\nBeyond Transverse was an in-between song between this and Ultimate Chaos, if I remember right. Might be wrong on the timing, but it was at some point in between something. It never felt \"done\", and it was actually one of the few times that I worked on a song over and over and over and over, to try and \"perfect\" it. Or in what I felt at the time, to \"fix it\". The bounce sounds nothing like what the `.band` file currently does. I didn't make backups as I edited it, so I ended up changing things like loop patterns, and a bunch of stuff. So the original project in it's state of the bounce, I am understood to believe doesn't exist anywhere. The weird time signature offset things with the loops, I don't think that was intended? It sounded cool, but I knew it was broken somehow. Looking back now, I wouldn't have it any other way. But I think I just didn't know what that song was supposed to be, and that was the issue. It got lost in trying to be something it wasn't, and it got confused along the way. And the ending part of it sounded different to the project file too, if I remember right. Again, same issues with the FX plugin thing, the \"DJ tool\" from GB iOS. So it probably had to do with Offline rendering as well.\r\n\r\nOkay to cover one more time, for my own sanity, since I went on a lot of tangents. This project was incomplete from original sources, and the mix files weren't inherently clear, nor are they lossless. So I did what I could to remaster them, after having converted them from M4A to WAV. I then fixed up things like zero-crossings at the start and ends of tracks, EQ pain points and clarity (bringing out certain frequencies that fell back into the mix, because of the lack of EQ in the actual mix), fixing volume consistency throughout the playback of the album (some parts were too loud, some too quiet, some were louder of quieter than they were intended from the beginning), and proper song transitions for where required. Lots of positives.\r\n\r\nI do feel like some of the heart of this record was in the imperfections too though, so I do think while this was a positive addition to the way this was conveyed as a project, fixing it kind of inherently removes some of it's honesty. I think both renditions are keen to keep for the entire explanation of what was learned from this. This one is the better \"listen\", in terms of the audio, and the original was a better \"learn\", and more honest to the source material itself.\r\n\r\nI did use some compression throughout the songs too, as it wasn't present before. I think sometimes the original was a bit jarring when it goes up and down so much. Part of that dizzying experience was, again though, part of what made it what it was. So it's up to you to decide which you like more. Again, to me, both are crucial in expressing the goals for different things. The original was an open-ended creative expression, with all of the raw parts embedded. This version is trying to re-mold that original dough into something that's at least a little bit more square.\r\n\r\nFood for thought 🙂\r\n\r\nThe original was purely done on an iPhone SE 1, with probably Skullcandy earbuds. That's it. So yeah, that's probably why it sounds like that.\r\n\r\nAnother aspect to the reason for deleting project files, and or not exporting as lossless. I did not have a computer of my own. My first phone was 8 GB (yes), an iPhone 5C. I did not have much space to store huge working projects. I had to have space for things like SimCity BuildIt, Clash of Clans, Vine, *and* GarageBand itself. Space was limited. Moving to the iPhone SE at 64 GB was like a breath of fresh air. So say for like Made in merica, the song Googolplex is totally missing it's `.band` file, merely because I could only export the song had I moved over all other songs for the project to the computer, and vice versa. So I actually had to get rid of parts of the project to finish it. Very ugly, but it \"worked™\". I am just glad that I even still have as many projects as I do from this time, because there are a few I just deleted because I got bored of them. That was from the Classic Projects era, so not any of these album ones. I think I only moved the actual `.band` projects over to my computer once I had my own. So they were on our other iPad for years, because I AirDropped them to there for \"storage\". Such a crazy thing. Now all of it is either on my Mac or on my external drive. I absolutely am living in luxury now, in terms of data management and storage. I am glad I started learning about that stuff. It helps immensely. Just safe practices in general are a good thing. I probably didn't really have any of those back then, other than just backing up my phone to the computer. I am happy I did that though, have to start somewhere, and I think it was just lack of knowing to save data safely, in that kind of concern of losing it.\r\n\r\nBut about this project, hypothetically I could have bounced it as lossless because I then had the storage with my new phone, but I didn't know the benefits of lossless, and I didn't have any playback places to know that it actually was better, or why I would think it was better. It wasn't until probably about a year ago as to when I discovered the audible difference between lossy and lossless. Groundbreaking, and kind of a bummer. Bought so much of my music on iTunes, and now I can hear (at least for releases 2008 and lower, essentially) that it's not as clear. I am currently concluding that most likely Apple encodes the lossless sources to M4A when the song is distributed from the artist, then the encoded file stays the same all these years later. But this means that music I buy from 1995, uploaded in 2002, it still sounds like a 2002-encoded AAC file. Bummer. But yeah. I didn't have the stereo, headphones, nor ear to hear the difference between lossy and lossless, so I had no inclinations to \"needing it\". Make sense?\r\n\r\nOh yeah, and the piano part in Gamma Rays wasn't meant to sound that bad, I just didn't have good timing tapping out the notes, and I was to consumed with going to fix it, as I think the quanitzation didn't work well for it, and I didn't have the patience to go back and fix the notes manually. I still don't have that patience lol. Listen to any of my tracks since 2020 with drum parts in them. Lol. My \"reasoning\" is that I'd rather focus on playing it better than to fix the ones I recorded badly. I could be working on another song rather than trying to fix the current song. Good mantra, bad mantra? I don't know. I also am too impatient to find the answer to that. Maybe that's why there's so many albums 😂\r\n\r\nThis remaster wasn't perfect either though, and I am also okay with that. Some songs inherently were hard to fix, namely Warp Velocity. The EQ cuts made definitely sound weird. I plainly didn't want this album to hurt to listen to though, so while it doesn't necessarily \"sound good\" in some parts, I have to either learn about things like automating EQ, or other complex concepts. So rather than trying to make it perfect now, again, the best I can currently do is the main goal. It is \"better\" than the original now, using these additional metrics, with clarity in mind. It is a more consistent listen now. I also needed to exercise getting over worrying about doing remasters. I had to start somewhere, and this album's original production definitely needed it. So again, net positive here. It was an inconsistent listen to start with, and I didn't want that to be present, that was the goal. It might not sound like the original, and that's okay. Just a second take on it. Some of the dynamics might have been nice to keep though, looking back at this remaster. Cascade isn't as clear in sound, Conspiracy isn't as scary (maybe it's the mid bass parts I removed too much, the high end isn't as clear), and the weirdness of Warp Velocity with the EQ cuts feeling a bit jarring in the ear (the song was painful, and now it's jarring; at least it doesn't hurt).",

    "about": "\"a compilation album\"!\r\n\r\nIn making a representative collection of songs for a friend of mine, I realized that the contents on the CD itself would be nice to have as a sort of starting ground for my releases which I am fond of myself (these are all songs I've released previous to this; the only outlier is \"Underwater Artillery\", which hasn't been made available until now; just a timing thing). These currently also seem to be in my own opinion some of my most fully-fleshed work too, whether it be compositionally, creatively, sonically, things like that. This one has funny moments, but it should be all of the ones that are memorable.\r\n\r\nIf you'd like your own CD copy, feel free to ask me to make one for you, or to burn a copy yourself, if you so please. Enjoy!\r\n\r\nI have and still do have a less keen feeling towards compilation releases, as I very much value the album experience and also the context that songs are placed together, and how they came about. That inherently seems to be how I structure my own albums in general, too. Like I seem to feel like an album is \"done\" when the ideas start to change creatively, or when I feel burnt out on a certain style. It seems to line up with life events too, whether it's change in schedules, seasons, end of the year, going to a new place, meeting new people, things like that. When your sphere of influence changes, that seems to be my internal marker for \"okay, this is no longer that original thing that it started as\". This has gotten more apparent with time I feel, because of practicing this. It could also just be part of letting go and being in the now, and trusting my instinct of \"okay this is complete now\". It used to be hard to do that. It still is, but now it's not as hard (that's what she said?).\r\n\r\nBut yeah, for the compilation album part of this, I think that's another thing I ~~have to~~ *want to* get over, it has it's utility, and it makes it easier to explain the kinds of music I do to other people, and that's always a good thing. Having a nice place for them to start is good. It might not be what I want from a release in the creative sense, but it is worth it to do that for people new to your work. It seems to also be a neat way for me to also internally catalog how things have gone over time, by listening to how each of the sounds of each song has changed over time.\r\n\r\nI intentionally didn't remix or remaster specifically for this release, as I wanted it to be a raw gathering of things over time. Note that there are remixes on here, those were done for their own benefit, not for this release specifically. I guess I could have included both versions of the ones that were remixed, but that seemed a bit counterintuitive to me. Maybe could have been cool though. I think the progression of mixing and mastering is apparent enough between the songs, having two versions of some songs seems a bit much, for on this release.\r\n\r\nThis was going to be called \"Sampler '25\", but that felt too generic. Another one was \"To Whom It May Concern\", but it also felt like it had been used previously.\r\n\r\nThe name for this came from when I had a realization on how I feel we are at in terms of the \"entertainment \"\"industry\"\" \", if you were to call it that. I don't mean in terms of the business side of things, but the personal enjoyment of entertainment itself. I realized that it seems like it is heavily rooted in business rather than plain old entertainment. If it was just entertainment, you can do that all by yourself. So what exactly are you paying people to do? I mean for big consumer content, be it reels, feeds, algorithms, big labels. Not an anti-business thing necessarily, but morseso, why is it that that is the only route that seems to be popular nowadays? \"Did you see that new show on Netflix?\" \"Do you stream with Spotify?\" \"No that's not on Paramount Plus yet.\". It's all around a big overarching brand. I know back in the day it was based around fame, celebrities, \"drama\" per se, and things like that (staying in the know with people you put on a pedestal), so it's not all sunshine and rainbows. It's just that now we don't have that, and in it's place, it's not even partially personable. It's all about ego. Maybe it always has been, but yeah. Wanna drive a cool car? It's because you want to look cool to your friends. Wanna go to the gym? It's because you want to impress a girl. Wanna dress up nice? It's to post on your social media, to which then other people compare themselves to you and put you on that pedestal. Or unintentionally making people jealous of your good looks. It seems like everything has strings attached for everything, again, to me it does. [this outlook] it's sickening. That's why I am doing things that are fun for me, and that make me happy. It's not to look cool, it's because I use it to push my comfort zone into places I haven't been before. I am typing my honest thoughts on the Internet. That's new! Rather than being like \"I wish people could be more open\", I am being more open. Again, not taking that as an \"I am better than you because I can be open\", simply just the observation. Instead, I lend you my hand to do the same. It is gratifying to let go in that way. Best time of my life [thus far]. The future has never felt brighter, because I am now always living in the now. You can't pay money for how good that feels. I hope others can feel the same essence of that. Only you can do that for yourself.\r\n\r\nOkay yeah. So uh. A new album. CDs are awesome, you have control over the content, they are lossless PCM, what else could one ask for? Oh yeah, and they have amazing backwards compatibility, they've been around for 40 years. It's awesome. Scratches are a bitch though 😃\r\n\r\nWas watching this just before I did the uploads here, very great timing.\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOmpyJUPHpg\r\n\r\nReally been in a music kick lately, not in an obsessive way, it just keeps finding natural ways back into plans lately. Very thankful for that. If you \"try to make it work\", that's when things get frustrated. This link found it's way into my eyes earlier this evening too, also very thankful to have found it. Your heroes are normal people just like us too (lol).\r\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/26drgn/this_is_mike_keneally_from_zappa_satriani/\r\n\r\nOkay, another realization after googling the name of this album. [generalizations incoming] People have become so disconnected from their ability to be in the now, that they are looking for abstractions to problems that don't need solving. It's the \"XY problem\" that is commonly mentioned in programming. Someone didn't get the input they needed when growing up, and or they got negative feedback. That gets internalized. They look for confirmation from outside sources to try to fill that void, which they were not taught to fill in their own fruition. They are now looking to get popular and get a lot of money, because they get validated by other people's opinions of them. So they want to become a guitarist. Guitarists get popular. They don't want to actually play guitar, they want the side effects of what it technically encompasses for people who are \"successful\" in the pop culture aspect of things (monetarily, \"perceived\" status [ego; how they *think* they will feel when they reach that place]). But that doesn't fix the root problem. So when they are looking to play guitar, they go to AI tools to write guitar parts for them, because it's not the music they are interested in. (a food for thought question, meant to be open-ended) Why else would anyone that is interested in music want to leave their space for interpretive input to some outside entity? They must be in it for different reasons than what I personally understand. Again, this is my perception. Why would I want a part of a song to be generated for me, when I can just learn how to make something that I enjoy more myself? For a learning tool, I could see it being used. It's not advertised as that though. That's what makes it ugly too. People are led to believe that these magical AI tools will get them the step forward that they need to \"get their foot in the door\". It's not about using the AI in their own fruition. It's just a \"cheat code\" at that point. We have all of this \"big data\" driving AI nowadays, plenty of it could be useful to people if we had realized what we could learn from it. Rather than have AI catch a fish for you, why not have it teach you to fish? If what it taught you was wrong, then just figure out the right answer. That's always an option. Say AI is like 3 wishes. If you could have it answer 3 of your own biggest questions, or teach you 3 different ways to answer your own biggest questions, which would you take? (hypothetical, that sounded cool, and the point comes across; I think AI is great for learning from, much like Wikipedia is; it could be wrong, and we realized why we don't cite Wikipedia anymore. Why is AI any different than Wikipedia?)\r\n\r\nListening to Synergy while writing this. Kind of went on a rant. Just gonna roll with it.\r\n\r\nreturning a few minutes later after a few other realizations...\r\n\r\nI'm also of the thought that I don't blame people and or industries for why they are the way they are. If they weren't to be like that, then they wouldn't have been. But they are. So rather than getting mad about what has happened thus far, what are we going to do about it *now*? It makes sense for companies to cater to what people want. It makes sense for people to buy what they want from companies. What doesn't make sense is why we as people look for certain things from companies, celebrity figures, what have you. We have the access to do that for ourselves. That's what I hope to see change, or rather, to gain awareness of. Maybe this is already a thing. Maybe I just don't know of it. I just know that this has been my observation and I just hope others can see their reliance on things that don't actually help them as well.\r\n\r\nSay one has a drinking problem. Drinking itself isn't the problem, it's the byproduct of another problem. WHY you drink is the problem. Or rather, what is causing you to need to want to drink, that's the problem. It is in our domain to learn why we do what we do. It doesn't have to be observed as \"good\" or \"bad\". That is a concern for another time. What will benefit you right now, in this moment? What positive steps can you take that will *lead* you towards where you want to be? Worrying about not being there yet isn't beneficial. Small steps are okay.\r\n\r\nAnother edit, later the next morning. It's the lack of knowhow of self-acknowledgement that stems the issue. That is [possibly] what causes those dangerous \"fixes\" to come about, whether it's drugs, alcohol. It \"solves\" the feeling, but it doesn't solve the cause of it. And when there are a lack of tools available to someone, they are going to do what they know how to do to try to solve that. Nobody is to blame for that. It's like if you told someone to build a spaceship or they are fired. This is McDonalds. Why would they know how to build a spaceship? So the goal is to make building a spaceship public knowledge, and not taboo to talk about. It's not wimpy to know how to build a spaceship, and it's something to be proud of. So it's in the interest and concern of adults and parents to be the strongest most teachable they can be for their children. How it is gone about is something to be solved on a case by case basis, a parent has to know their own faults, and to work around them. Maybe they don't know their own faults, that is the very hard part. How do you become perceptive of your own limitations, which were placed onto you, because of some external factor? It's not your own fault that it's like that. It's just your duty to learn what they are, and to either counteract them in parenting, or to, in a pedestrian way, explain it to your young ones to where they can understand, and not internalize those struggles as being part of them as well.\r\n\r\nSo I think it is a big part around being self-aware on a personal level. That seems to be what is the missing key, from my opinion, perspective, what have you. I don't know if it's the truth, but right now, in making choices around that being the premise, it really seems to be helping me grow as a person. Finding your limitations, whether that's what you have created under your own fruition, or the ones that were implicitly handed down to you, because they weren't caught upstream. The tools may not have been available prior to you to catch them. That's going to happen, and it's not some magic bullet to solve all of your problems. You aren't going to be perfect. But as they say, you can sure try to be. And that's what counts. The worst is being aware of your problems and issues, and not doing anything about it. It turns into a downward spiral unbelievably swiftly.\r\n\r\nI'm no magician though, nor a therapist. So I urge you to please do this work on your own, for you as well. I don't have the answers for you, as I also don't have the answers for me. This is just what I have been ruminating about. Hope all is well. Whether we like it or not, we got this 😂",

    "about": "Took a few days to ruminate on how I feel the results of the 2025 remix for \"so, many, bad, decisions\" turned out, and came back with some interesting thoughts.\r\n\r\nJust realized that I have learned a lot about mixing and mastering, both in the things I have learned up until now, and what I also have done wrong thus far. Compression and dynamics have been mixed up in my mind, in terms of how you use them, like what you are trying to achieve. Same with EQ. The intentions were in the right place, but when and how I was utilizing each of them, I still have much more to learn in that regard.\r\n\r\nSo I fully do not regret doing the remix. It does not quite sound to the extent I hoped it would have though, and I'm not sure any remix will \"fix\" that album per se though. It might have just needed a simple remaster from the raw mixes again, rather than EQing everything and rebalancing it all again in terms of levels. So I think I knew what I was trying to do, but not quite how to do it.\r\n\r\nThe contrary to this realization, is that I think I have to let it be what it is. Realizing things like certain parts being not quite nice enough in the mix, there are small things like that. But going back and fixing it over and over, that isn't helping either. I tried something new, overall it was a net positive to the representation of that project, and I am proud of how it turned out. It is a nice counterpart in addition to the original. I still enjoy the punchiness of some songs and sections on the original, that seems to be what I felt was lacking with the remix in some respects. While it is less \"flat\" and \"blurry\", it is lacking in energy as well.\r\n\r\nSo the response to this scenario? I feel the drive again to try experimenting and just letting loose again, not maybe necessarily in terms of the \"anything goes\" approach that Recreational was, but more in that I feel it's time for creation again, rather than refinement.\r\n\r\nOkay, so that's where we are today. I started feeling the drive of just \"trying to make things\" again, albeit even if it's messy, and or whatnot. I am still onboarding all of the critiques I learned from things like Recreational, DEBUG, and \"so many remixes\" (as I like to call it), and rather than trying to \"perfect\" those with the new things I learned, I'd rather put that new found knowledge and perspectives into new things to delve into. That feels really productive to me too. It's that you tried something, learned something, and moved on to the next thing.\r\n\r\nFelt a nice tuning over the last week or so, again, so that's what this is spurred from. That was just the inclination of what was interesting again. It is some sort of open tuning, in some kind of semi-tone I think (doesn't line up to 440hz). So it's not in \"tune\", but the guitar is in tune with itself, so I think it works very nicely. Originally, this sound really felt inspired (in practice) by Daisy Rickman's album Howl. I wasn't specifically trying to sound like her, whether that's sound or genre, but the parts that it's rooted in, whether that's presence/musicality, or whatever \"essence\", I think that album came into the front of my mind again. The rawness of the tuning seems to be what I am looking for right now. It's a raw album, like just an honest, open kind of one.\r\n\r\nAs of writing this, I wrote these 3 songs today on the 9th, and they seem to be kind of ambient/etherial, and heavy as well. I think I like the lower/open tunings for both ambient and heavy too, it seems like those kind of songs tend to come out of me when I am in that tuning. Standard tuning seems to be more solos, and the half-down Drop D seems to be Primus and or Keneally-eque, to some extent. Standard tuning seems to lend itself to me writing more conventional song structures too. Regular Dropped D seems to be very ominous in writing, and the half-down Drop D seems to be also possibly Alice in Chains-ey, but with a heavy chuggy thing too, so possibly things like Strapping.\r\n\r\nThe artwork was from some pictures of myself that were taken at a haircut, for some reason when seeing that picture, my internal voice for describing myself from how I saw \"me\", was \"progger\". So something called to me in that way. Whatever that was, that seemed to tie it all together, and I went and made these three songs. Again, Fall Festival is the current one as of writing this.\r\n\r\nKeneally interview is awesome, watched it last night:\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8EBiEVHAls\r\n\r\nGilmour interview is awesome as well, watched it tonight:\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT_KFCidz_s\r\n\r\nDan Worrall is a great guy, he has an awesome channel about mixing. Learned some new things from him which I used on Fall Festival. Check out the Voxengo Sound Delay. It very much helps with the uncanny valley which is hard panning. I don't know what I am doing yet, as expected, so it might sound a bit rough still. I think it worked nice though, so I went with what I had tried.\r\nhttps://www.voxengo.com/product/sounddelay/\r\n\r\nThis project is not complete, to emphasize. This is another, find out what this thing is, as I go, kind of thing.\r\n\r\nThe artwork turned out insanely cool, wow. Made it fully all myself.\r\n\r\nEdit next day: Okay, added two more songs, Sandwiches and Rains. I totally dig rains. Both are great, but Rains is perfect, for lack of better words.\r\n\r\nHad some fun making a back cover, aka jacket for this project. This one definitely feels like a cohesive work, even if it is a bit out there. It seems to have a vision in terms of style, and what it is. Maybe even if a bit stringent in straightforward-ness, or whatever, I internally know what this thing is. The current artwork represents it so well. That's why I felt like making the jacket for it, for the first time. The style of it seems very visible in my mind, now.\r\n\r\nIt is giving me concepts of Devin Townsend Infinity. Whether or not the music is similar, and or the vision, or what have you, the idea that the work itself is itself a \"thing\", that's the part that this seems to relate to me with in the concept here. Maybe it is just because I like the artwork a lot. The concept of the music really could be anything at all. So maybe it is just that. I am not to worry about what it is though, simply just to make the work into what it feels like what it is.\r\n\r\nMight be fun to order real CDs for this afterwards, since I made the artwork and jacket combo. It might be the paper CD sleeve which this could be in, rather than a jewel case. I mean, a jewel case would work too. Haven't tried a paper sleeve yet though, so maybe that's the intriguing part.\r\n\r\nThis seems to be a very effect-y project, just totally drenched in processing and custom sound fields. The artwork was a result of a similar temptation. They weren't inherently meant to be the same, but it seemed to come from the same kind of experimentation. So that worked nicely, because it wasn't intentional. The artwork was going to have a red background and just my regular picture. Then I started messing around with a bunch of different layers, color adjustment concepts, filters, and the final artwork showed itself to me, just like that. It looked so cool. Then I did some other tweaks, and the background ended up turning gray. That seemed to work a lot actually, so it wasn't dark red anymore. The filters made a nice effect of blending me into the background too, rather than being placed right on top of it. And as I have usually been doing, I reexported the final artwork as CMYK, as I really enjoy the print color aesthetic. For my own enjoyment of it, it feels like something much more tangible, like it has already been printed out, and I had scanned the artwork again, or something like that. It removes some of that \"digital edge\", per se. (If some of these phrases are on album names, this is because I wrote them right now, and they sound like great names, so I am archiving them for later. I didn't try to reference the work in this paragraph, I just found the phrases through writing and then it stuck in my brain as being cool) So it's kind of like how tape is to me, like giving that real world feel. It has a logical use too, since I print paper artwork for my own pressing of my projects, to CD jewel cases, and printers only use CMYK. So in finding out about catering artwork towards CMYK, I actually enjoyed the look of it, so I started using it artistically as well. I think some of the first times I realized I actually liked the look was for things like Up the Downstair. That seems to have some sort of blooming on the cover, even on the digital artwork. I think probably because it was printed, then scanned for digital release, afterwards. I'm not totally sure. But that essence of that, I personally enjoy.",

    "about": "(work in progress! released but not complete, keep tuned for more updates; songs are not mastered yet, so they are a bit quiet)\r\n\r\nReally inspired by learning about mixing and mastering, as I have mentioned previously. With that new perspective, I had a gigantic awakening about how bad (relative to now) my previous mixes for releases really were. I think the most recent two projects especially brought that to light. It's that I saw that I was able to make really nice mixes for my work, even if the writing is still in my haywire style. It really does come down to just proper level management, like gain staging, and inherently, compression.\r\n\r\nI recently started looking into what parts of a mix that are important to me personally. I very much value dynamic takes, as well as a nice low-end, and clear high end. Without being too mathematical like that (because it's hard to explain things clearly without real-world examples), right now my mix inspiration is somewhere in feeling between Mike Keneally & Beer for Dolphins Sluggo! and Sevendust Home. If the \"sound\" of those had a crossover in production styles, it possibly could be these. Whether my work actually sounds like either parts from those, I don't know. I'm not trying to worry about what my new concepts \"sound like\", in relation to other things. All I am focusing on is figuring out what things click for me when I listen to the albums I love, and now I am trying to trust my own process to figure out whether I sonically like the \"sound\" of my music, rather than just the creative influence of it.\r\n\r\nI am going to release the progress for this second version of this album, as I go. So the songs are not mastered yet, I will do that with a final bounce at the end of the mixing stages (I mix each song independently, then I bounce them, and master them together into a seamless crossfaded project, then bounce each track from that session; this is what I did for Recreation and DEBUG. I very much am digging that new addition to the workflow).\r\n\r\nSeeing how much you can collect the essence of the album with something like mastering, it's groundbreaking. I've always struggled with having songs properly flow into one another, as well as having them at the volume I thought they should be at in my head. Let alone dynamics preserved, but that's a whole other story.\r\n\r\nBecause I have used GarageBand iOS for my final bounces for such a long time, that's all I knew. Same with mixing capabilities. Now I see that there is a lack of clarity in terms of being able to see the mix in terms of EQ, leveling, and gain staging. My mixes tend to have been running too hot, because I didn't know about headroom, in regards to 0db. GarageBand iOS also applies auto-normalization on export. I did not know the application of what EQ was inherently used for. I know you were \"supposed\" to use it, but I now see that I really just didn't understand it because my ear hadn't practiced that kind of auditory listening before. It's a different mindset than listening to the song like you would a fan. It's more about the sonic experience itself, to figure out what works or doesn't work in the arrangement. I didn't have the personal context of driving that process, so inherently, the work reflects that. I had always felt my mixes felt very blurry, and or fuzzy, and flat. All of these parts to the puzzle explain that.\r\n\r\nLearning from various people, there are also parts that gravitate towards whether the arrangement lends itself to working nicely to being mixed too, whether it's double tracking, panning, counterparts, melodies, instrument choices. Not saying those are all good or bad, but rather that the inherent result of those decisions, that's what determines how the project is to be mixed. And one of my newer goals in relation to that, is to try and think of that, even if just a little, from the beginning of the project. Not that you have to make it sound like that right when you record it, but that you write parts for each other, rather than throwing them all at the dartboard because you feel like it. If that's what the song dictates for you, then okay, so be it. Heck yeah. But if it's because you don't know any better, then there might be some learning to do there. I'm all for both. Intentional insanity? Heck yes. Unintentional muffling? That's when you get disappointed by the result of your work. It's simply because there's more to learn, and you're just not quite to that point. It's okay, and it has to happen that way.\r\n\r\nThat's another counterpart to this. It's that I absolutely do not regret my decisions before this point. Because the only reason I am here learning about all of this and how it works, it's because I found I was very much not pleased with the result of my work. I started noticing how I had room to grow. The things I would let slide before, just because I felt they didn't bother me (because really, they didn't, it was just for fun), they started to bug me. That's when I realized I had to make some changes. Just start asking questions, rather than getting mad at the result and giving up. \"Why do I dislike this new song I made? Even though it was fun to write?\" \"Why does it sound like that?\" \"Why doesn't it sound like <another reference project>?\" \"What would I change to make it sound more like <another reference project>?\" If you don't know the answer to something, then that's where you look into things next. If you aren't feeling up to it now, and it feels like you don't believe in the work because you feel bad about it, then give it a rest. Not all of the things have to be solved now. The fact that you got to this point at all is already great progress. You are helping yourself get better. It will be difficult, and seeing it with fresh eyes and ears is all the difference. Just give it time, new perspectives bring new light to things.\r\n\r\nI used to take a long time to release my projects, I think because I have the tendency to hold on tight to things I work dearly on. I am proud of that. It also comes with it's hard parts, in that it might restrict the project from being all that it can be, because you don't trust the process. I now have been practicing trusting the process more, releasing things on the fly, finishing projects sooner, that kind of thing. The underlying part though, is that I am intentionally helping myself not be so close to it. It's about like letting the mistakes stay in the recording, embracing them. Just because a mix might not quite be perfect, if it's better than it sounded yesterday, then that's great. That's progress. If you know it needs work, and you don't know why, then I will let it go and release it as is. To some extent I have been good at this since working on music the last few years, as I really haven't been 100% fully pleased with the sound of things as I finished them. But that's the thing. You can't be fully pleased, so the thing to work on is to not worry about it when you've done everything in your current power to make it the best of what it can be *right now*. This project is an example of that. I was very happy with this release musically, and sonically, at the time. Looking back now though, I see what additionally could have come of it. I didn't have the perspective to see that back then. So I can't blame myself for not having done it like this back then. That's where you can lead yourself forward. Rather than toiling in the despair of what the project isn't, just do your absolute best of what you know you can do now, then when you run out of tools, leave the project, allow it to be complete, and stand behind your abilities as they are now. Rather than trying to perfect something to which you are lacking the tools to make, instead use that time to focus on learning what tools you are missing, and keep learning those and practicing them.\r\n\r\nI was going to mention this probably two paragraphs ago. I was very much debating whether I should even make a remix or remaster for this project.\r\n\r\nThe debate: Do I let the project be what it was when I made it, and stand behind that, and all of the learning it encompassed up to now? Or do I breath the life into the project which I wasn't able to at the time, now that I am able to?\r\n\r\nAlso with that, but really a separate scope of questioning: Do I replace the original mix on the release with this new updated version, because it is \"better\" (loaded take, that's where the issue is), or do I release it as a counterpart to the original?\r\n\r\nThat question threw me for a loop, because it had a very inherently deep set of implications I had to unwind a bit to answer properly. \"Better\" is an opinion. Opinions are subjective. Yes, while more work has gone into this new version than the previous version, that doesn't mean that it is \"better\". \"Better\" defines whether someone likes something, based on the criteria that they define for it being good. That is on a personal level. This then opened my eyes to checking out other albums I have loved in the past and current, and realizing that me personally, I actually very much enjoyed the non-remastered versions more than the remastered. But again, this seemed to be on an album-by-album basis. So even for me, with albums I like, it depends on the album itself. It's not that remasters are always better, it's that if what you are looking for in an album isn't in it to begin with, and a remaster would provide that for you, then yes, the remaster is for you. If the latter is the case, then the original is for you. Say the Devin Townsend Infinity remaster, I realized it has less of the EQ curve that I enjoy from that album (as to how I heard it when I first heard it; the parts I liked weren't present there), as well as more compression. For me, the parts about the album that I liked, were how raw and strong it was. Yes, I agree, it sounds rough since it was recorded like that, but again, to my own personal opinion, that's what made the album what it was, FOR ME. I understand why cleaning it up in a few ways, yes it makes it more like music out nowadays. But that's the part that I don't connect with. I specifically like that it doesn't sound like anything else, that's why I connected with it. And another example, say Mike Keneally & Beer for Dolphins Sluggo!, I very much adore the new 2013 mix. It is much clearer in terms of EQ and dynamics, and I think the original had some tape artifacts if I remember reading correctly too. The underlying part to both cases though, which I am not saying will always be true across the board, but has been true for the albums I've looked into thus far, is that it seems like I tend to always pick the sound which I heard first, regardless of which it is. Like if I heard the remastered before the original, then I would likely pick the remastered. If I heard the original before I heard the remastered, I would probably pick the original. Again, this on paper seems to be *how I operate* thus far. I am curious about whether this will change with future listens, I am eager to see. I listened to Genesis Selling England by the Pound, and I heard the remaster first. I listened to parts of the original, and I still liked the remaster. Yet again, it ended up being that I liked the remaster.\r\n\r\nTo wrap back around, after realizing all of those parts about myself and my own associations to things, as well as my inclinations about \"betterness\", and how it is subjective, in correlation with realizing that I am only capable of doing right now what I am able to do, I am going to release this project remixed and mastered again, and keep the original intact as it's own. Personally, I intend to enjoy this remix/remaster more than the original, since I ended up not quite being pleased with the original. However, I can't make that choice for you, you have your own inclinations to things, and I want to embrace that. As well as, my goal with my work is to be as logically transparent about the growing process here, much like open source code. I am using this to learn about myself, and I am hopeful that my learnings can be of help to anyone who finds themself in a similar path to mine. And obscuring the less better version of the album only hinders that learning process. Instead, say like you wanted to know why certain EQ choices were made in this remix, and or compression and things like that. They might only make sense because you went and listened to the original. The last thing I want to do is to prevent that correlation from being accessible, to obscure it. Being able to simply diff the two tracks and discern the creative choices sonically between the two, that's priceless to be able to do. At least for me anyways, that's exactly how I learned from the releases I mentioned above. So, why wouldn't I also want to make that accessible of my work as well?\r\n\r\nEvent if I end up finding out I don't like doing remixes, I will learn that by doing this one.\r\n\r\nEdit Sep 15: Doing tracks 8 through 11 today. Went back and adjusted a few levels for Philosophy, and removed the mix bus EQ for all previous tracks. Realized that I want to start with a clean slate when doing EQ and compression for mastering, since I might unintentionally just undo what I did during the mix anyways. Might as well allow it to breath closer to what it sounded like in the first place. Easier to inspect in terms of original frequencies intent.\r\n\r\npogcat wasn't much work, I very much have really liked the mix for that, just the clipping and compression from GarageBand was the main issue. I did widen the stereo panning for the guitars, that is a change I may revert though. Will listen back and decide whether that caters to the song or not.\r\n\r\nI realized I think I mixed a lot of these using the stereo monitors, rather than headphones, and I am curious how much that influenced both the original mix, as well as my use of headphones now.\r\n\r\nActually, I forgot, I added some of the original grit back into WELUTT too, since that (unintentionally) was kind of the point of the sound, it was supposed to be ugly, in a way.\r\n\r\nOkay, this is probably 5 minutes later. The mix for pogcat was perfect to begin with, even with it's ugliness. I did make the drums a fraction of a db more visible in the mix though, so I reverted the panning changes.\r\n\r\nEdit Oct. 4 '25:\r\n\r\nJust started the remix for Pineapple Parrot and Cheese Cat tonight. So they don't have much better of things in terms of EQ, if anything I removed some of the defaults which seemed to still be present on the main tracks, I didn't seem to have removed them at the time. It was much more hastily done than I had remembered doing. Pineapple Parrot already sounds multitudes better, it was so crushed and fuzzy before.\r\n\r\nA lot of the edits I made this morning and tonight (well, right now it's 1:14 AM, so the 3rd really), I had started to take inspiration from the music I have loved lately. Namely, Mike Keneally and Beer for Dolphins Sluggo, The Who Tommy, Queen Jazz!, and a bunch of others. Maybe not in name specifically, in terms of like specific aspects I am borrowing from each of them, but that I had realized that I really enjoy stereo panning. I think when I had made this album now two years ago, I still was keen to not pan as wide when mixing with headphones, because it sounds much much wider than how wide it is(n't?) on the stereo. So now I think my mental model for stereo panning in mixing, it's much wider than it used to be. Multitudes of these tracks have much more breathing room than they did previously. I have to say, it is changing the chaotic nature of the project a bit, back to more lighthearted and silly. I am also kind of okay with however it sounds. I am curious whether the chaotic notion will kind of resurface when I go to properly mastering everything, or if this [album] will generally be less uncanny overall.\r\n\r\nSome tracks really do breathe so much better than before, it's absolutely awesome. Some are having trouble finding their way though, namely because I don't quite know how to mix vocals naturally yet. I seem to have gotten a hang of my trio-stereo kind of thing, where you have maybe two guitars (well isn't that a quartet then?), then drums and bass in the middle. But vocals? Well, then that's a different story. Lots of other clashing frequencies I have yet to know how to cut, by muscle memory. The other ones I seem to get close enough on the first try now, practice sure works it's magic!\r\n\r\nIt's been about 3 weeks I've been working on this remix, and I am very proud of myself by how I came about at it. I am making multiple changes across multiple sessions, and I am not obsessing about getting it done all at once. I think it's because I started to see how taking breaks really does help you with hearing it with new ears. Listening in the car really does help bring things to fruition too, that's been helping a lot. I do keep having to remind myself that it's not mastered yet though, because I keep wanting to make certain things brighter. But now I see the point of mixing, and of mastering. Mixing is where you choose which parts of which sections should poke out from each instrument at a given time. Mastering simply makes these certain frequency ranges more apparent or not. So once something is hidden behind something else, mastering can't do a damn thing about it. This totally makes sense for how those stem splitter tools work too, because it's not like the whole sound is all there once it's mixed, that's the point of mixing. When one thing takes more presence, you lose what was behind it. Say like you flatten an image in Photopea, you can figure out what came from each layer, but you don't know what was in that layer underneath the obscuring part above. That's exactly how mixing works. So with that in mind, I have been pushing certain parts of each instrument to make those parts of that instrument more apparent, then I plan to lower the output of those master resulting frequencies back down to make it more streamlined. Say like you see the sun through the trees, that's what I'm doing. If the sun wasn't that bright, you could only see parts of it through the trees. But because it's so bright, it's really visible through the trees, it even makes rays of light on the ground. That's what I am trying to do with my mixes. Right now, it seems to be the kind of sound I want. It seems like you could call it \"frequency bleeding\" or something. Not sure if it's what other people do, or if it's good or bad, but it seems to be doing how I hope to accomplish with the sound. Same with the bass and treble, bass guitar and frequencies are intended to be a huge part of this, for some reason. I love when it feels super big, like this wide truck coming through your stereo. Wall of sound, but more like wall of waves, or something. Another note, turning down things from 1k to 6k just about, it helps immensely with listening fatigue, it's been awesome. Will also do this in mastering. 3k is also evil, by the way. Putting cuts for that inside of the mix for each track, before needing to do it in mastering, it helps so much. It just helps things that it might obscure from being more visible now. Say like a sound is loud and hurts because it's 3k. That peak now hides other frequencies which might be crucial to the full context as well. This mitigates that. It's like your cutting off the part of the branch of the tree that blocks the sun on your favorite bench.\r\n\r\nEdit: Alright! As of Oct. 7, this is now the final mix and master for the whole project! Going to listen back a bunch to this, to see what I do and don't like about it. Debating whether I will make any changes if there's anything I find while listening back to it. This definitely has a different feel to it than the first one, regardless of that being a good or bad thing. I have yet to find out. I'm keeping in mind that I am glad that I tried doing this, rather than whether the goal itself was successful or not. Time will tell.\r\n\r\nThe original public date for this was Sept 12, and I finished it today on Oct 7, so it took just about a month for the whole remix, and last night/this morning for the mastering. I really worked this time on not trying to be too close to the work all at once, like getting \"obsessed\" with it. I did kind of get that way this weekend, but if anything because I felt I didn't want to have this drag on any longer in terms of edits. It seems just about as close to what I can get out of it, with my current skillset. So I kind of just pushed through and did the last few songs mixes this weekend(day), then did the mastering. I had already kind of demoed how I was going to master each song, in each song itself, I simply just didn't bounce the mix files with those, they were bypassed. Overall, I am very happy with how much flavor and life this brought back to these songs. I think I will need to take some time to appreciate the work I did for this, as right now I can ultimately sense I am too critical of it, too close to it. But that's also why I wanted to push through to the end too, because I knew it was getting to that \"hyper-critical\" point, where things get frustrating over moot things, which are inconsequential. This is a net positive, so I am going to let it be as such 🙂\r\n\r\nRUSH IS TOURING AGAIN? 😃😃\r\n\r\n*edit: Oct 20 '25\r\n\r\nDammit, alright. I was going to try not to go back and make edits after having told myself that I wouldn't, but I did. This time I really am though. I think I am not totally happy with the accuracy of this remix/remaster. The main thing is just the \"vibe\" of the songs seems to be lost for me. I went and fixed it in some regards today, with a few things I made mental notes of when going back to listen to it. Mainly removing some compression, adding some, changing some master gain and compression for certain tracks, a whole bunch. So some sound really good I think, and some don't feel right and I don't know why. But I really need to move on from this one. As it currently stands, I am not one for remixing. Being close to the material is the only way I know how to make it work, and not obsess over it. I have to feel that it's right, in the moment, having just made it. And because the original sound was created by improper gain staging in GarageBand, and lots of limiting (on the master tracks; again, not intentional), a lot of the sound was achieved in ways I don't fully know how to replicate again, with the new clearer mixes. Ideally it would be more perceptive and EQ-ed to certain parts, that was the goal, and I would just fix the limiting issues. But maybe the point this whole time, is that yes, the ugly mix is the mix itself. I don't know. Once again, this is the case of where the more you know, the more perceptive you are to that you don't know a fucking thing (not to be pessimistic; lol). I don't think there is, right now at least, a way that I can make this mix into something I will be happy with. Maybe that will change, maybe another remix in the future will work better. Either way, I think I need to move on from this one. Maybe I could have stuck with the original mix more in the beginning and simply fixed the mastering issues. Aaagh. This is a mess. But I tried, and that's a good thing. I don't regret what I tried, I just am bummed that I am not happy with the result. I can't tell if it's \"better\" now, that's what's weird. I think logically, it does sound clearer, more intentional. I don't know if I like it more though. That may just be the uncertainty here. After all this work, I thought it would be a no brainer that this version is much better. And I am not feeling that. And I don't want to have version after version of the same album. I am trying to be okay with that being the case, but I don't know if I want to be okay with it either. Again, I'd rather be putting energy into trying it with a new sound, than the same trodden path I made a few years ago. That makes sense as well. If I am going to try new mixing and mastering styles, they might as well shape the aesthetic of a new concept or album style as well, rather than trying to pander one set of writing to another style. That feels to be the internal problem.\r\n\r\nAfter having just written that, I feel amazing. That clears the air. I am not against remixes or remasters in their own right. I just am not happy with how it turned out here, and I don't think I want to do them quite yet. I don't have the \"ear\" for it, nor the practiced workflow to decipher keeping the original \"intent\" of the original compositions, while making it also sound better.\r\n\r\nIt is weird though, in that when I made this album the first time, I also wasn't totally happy with the mix/master. Maybe moreso the master, I don't know. I hadn't known the gain staging/limiting issues were there, so that was definitely part of it. But I remember feeling like I had to let go of the things I didn't like about it as well, be it the messy recordings, weird clicks at the end of songs, a bunch of stuff.\r\n\r\nSo maybe that's why I don't like this either, it's not the remix, it's not the master. It's that there are blisters throughout this album, and trying to shave them off and make it into something new, that's not helping either.\r\n\r\nSo, maybe, lesson learned. As they say, you can't make a turd into a faberge egg. I don't think anyone has said that, but I like the sentiment of it. I also don't think this album is a turd. It has a beam of light through the heart of it, and I think regardless of how it is mixed, mastered, recorded, it is still shrouded in the difficulties that made it come to it's fruition. And there's nothing I can do to change that about this. It is all there, like it or not. The strife of the difficulties around the time period I wrote it in, the personal struggles with others and myself at the time, that's all there. And maybe trying to work through this album again, it could be reconnecting with those again, and that is very difficult. Not that I specifically don't want to stay connected with that part of me, but that I find it hard to look at it through the same eyes as that time period again, being a different person now.\r\n\r\nI feel like the same thing applies with say if I were to remix Elkosaurus Tex. I would love for that project to be more fully fleshed out like my projects now. But it would be a heck of a thing to delve into again, pull apart, rebuild, yack.\r\n\r\nNow, something else to learn from this. I would love to have the ability to be able to reconnect with past times like that, and not have it bother your current state like it used to. That is also something I can work on, and would be very powerful to do. Not sure if that's self-acceptance, and or self-awareness. Definitely sounds like it. Maybe it just has to happen with more time, then. That also makes a lot of sense. Regardless of mixing and mastering skills (which would be great to have more of when redoing a project), I think having a larger perspective on that original time period, and where you were as a person back then, that is part of the thing. I can work on that, and I am very interested in that.\r\n\r\nIf you try to do it on a similar level to where you were then, it is too close. But with time, and perspective, you can honor that state of you, through your new caring eyes.\r\n\r\nOkay, gonna go check if Beer for Dolphins Dancing is in the mail, then maybe do some new recordings today. See ya! ❤️\r\n\r\nedit ~20 minutes later. Fuck it. This sounds insanely awesome. Fuuck iiittt!!! I love how much better this sounds. Comparing the remix to itself, you get stuck in a loop. Comparing the remix to the original, oh my fucking god. It's fucking crazy. This sounds outstanding. I'm proud of what I made here, and I now don't want to change anything about it. Done. Time to let go. Part of this might be that I added a custom little descriptor to the artwork too, just a little \"2025\" thing at the top, to signify the difference. I love this. I need to burn a CD of it, right now. We'll see if I make the artwork or not for it though, been printing a lot recently, don't want to be too much of an ink hog. Wow though, I forgot just how much the original sucks in terms of mix. Or rather, I forgot how much of a long way I've come in mixing/mastering, fuck me! (again, not pessimistic, just shocked; british slang).\r\n\r\nOkay, kudos. Been through hard shit, came out the other side (as mentioned in \"Philosophy\", reference unintended), and now I am happy. What else can I ask for. Fuck yeah.\r\n\r\n[p.s. the working title in my head/on my computer, for this: \"so many remixes\"]",

        "about": "Doing some random research about various audio formats (hello as of Oct 29 '25), I found out that the word \"illicit\" exists too. I have a hunch that this is the version of this title that I had kind of been picturing in my mind, when paired with \"Transpose\". I feel it's too late to change it, so it's okay now. But I think it does make sense. I must have been watching a Louis Rossmann video or something, I think it might be about like when you record or transpose an existing set of media into something else. Not sure what this has to do with the song really itself, but it seems that \"concept\" of sorts, I think that was on the mind at the time. It might have had to do with Minecraft NBT parsing too, essentially how you 'map' (programming term) between one format to another. In that scenario, illicit might not be as explanatory, so I don't know for certain. I think it was just a random title to be honest. It had to have come from some real world inspiration I was intrigued with at the time though, and this discovery brought me back here. A similar thing happened with \"Levy\" on Transcend. It is now called \"Levee\", because that is the actual thing I had on my mind when picturing the song. But my written \"Levy\" didn't actually equate to that. I think I had renamed that when I uploaded it to Bandcamp, to \"fix\" it. I kind of like the personability of \"Levy\" a little more though.",

        "about": "Wow, I am so glad I am doing this remix and inherently, remaster. This song is flourishing so much more. It's weird, because all along, when I was listening to this song, this is what I \"heard\", or rather it's how I was hearing it in my head, rather than it actually being able to sound like that. So it's intriguing to me how that works. It's like if the mirror is blurry, you see a silouette of your person, but it's not you in the fullest sense. You know it's you though, and you can perceive that. But the image doesn't convey it to the extent that you know you are. That's what this remix is doing, how I internalized this song, it is now much closer in sound to that idea.\n\nI love this so much, this totally changed the game for me, as well as adding a whole new dimension(s) of perspective in terms of expression and creativity for myself. So far I am by far the most happy with how this song turned out as part of the remix. Let alone is it less taxing to listen to (in my opinion, lol; I know content-wise the song is insane, however ..) because sonically it was a challenge too. There were just a lot of spikes and inconsistencies previously. Like for example, using a DeEsser on the vocal part (twice, before and after EQ) it very much made things less painful to your ear. That was part of the equation of issues before. And plainly, everything kind of just mushed together in terms of tonal quality. It is much better now, and clearer. Applying EQ to the mix bus (eek, I know, doing it in mastering is more ideal, but it makes it easier to tell what to raise and lower when things are properly leveled for their frequencies) very much helped clarify the sound. It's like if previously, I had kept the impurities of frequencies for each track, stirred all of the tracks together into a mush, then flattened it into a pancake. This song was highly suffering from gain staging if I remember right, so inherently the final bounce was much more flat and very hard to tell about dynamics. So maybe dynamics could just be the biggest part here as well. Those are no two small components of the mix working though, so I am 1000% amazed with just how much simply changing the process of the stems fixes so much of the *crap* haha. It's not like the recordings themselves were bad, they just aren't \"pure\" to start with. It's like you have to filter them down to their essential essences, then choose how to align those properly in reference to adjacent sounds in those similar frequency ranges.\n\nYada yada, yoda yoda, I make silly music, woop woop. Go buy a donut, will ya??\n\nBut yeah, I can only understate how tremendously awesome this is. And the fact that it's all under my own control? Heck yeah! Not that I need full control, but more that there's not any \"lossy communication\" or perception of ideas. The way I hear it in my head, it's very near to my abilities to articulate them by way of my ear. Adding in a layer of abstraction and someone else's biases to what the song might need, or what they think I might want it to sound like, that adds much more room for \"error\" if you will. I am very much open to new viewpoints to why it sounds good or bad to someone else though. I want that after having committed to how I want it to sound though, not before. Because it's different if you are getting critiqued on the concept of how you are trying to convey how you want to song the sound, versus how the song sounds. It's much more actionable I feel. With the amount of things we have to deal with lately and how much of it is within our control or not, I am very much practicing only focusing on things I can control, rather than worrying about things I can't. It's undoubtedly freeing. If you have struggled with that kind of worry previously I hope you can feel a similar release of \"control\". It's odd, because it's not that I have less control now, if anything, I just changed my goals to be into things which I do have ability to act upon. If something isn't working, maybe you just need to change your perspective on it. Like in the 2D world Flatlands (not my game, the concept), you can't see over the top of the line, that's because it's a 3D object. You need the new perspective to see that you can go over it. So it's up to us to learn how to go from being merely 2D viewers to being 3D viewers. That sounded very fancy. It was meant to merely relate to Flatlands the concept, but I can see how it can also very open-endedly be applied really nicely to whatever concept it might help you figure out, which you are struggling with.\n\nIt's great how things work their way back into your life too, very interesting, and amazing, for lack of better words. A lot of the concepts on this album are coming full swing back into things I am having to deal with. So it's weird how I only just how started having things make sense on being able to remix this project. The timing of it's message with the project, coming back to it now lines up with what I needed to hear in this point in time. Invaluable.",

    "about": "This \"project\" started from the fallout of what the previous projects before this had turned into. It was me striving to rekindle the concept of making a lighthearted release, where the songs were simple because they were enjoyable.\r\n\r\nWell, actually, I had thought of the idea of making projects of distinct genres under all new names. I loved and still love the concept of this, yet it didn't flesh out because I was trying to make genres of songs I didn't know how to make, nor was familiar in listening to myself, so I didn't even have a real reference of how to make it.\r\n\r\nThis essentially consists of three different folders of projects, which ended up being demos for what I concerned them to be. It was one of those things where the songs are neat, but they don't quite work or fit in the projects adjacent to when they were made. So maybe it was just a transitional time in general. The time period was after DEBUG INTERNAL ERROR, before starting to work on 'so many remixes', and then progger.\r\n\r\nSo it was in practice, August 26 through to September 24. I was essentially trying to start up whatever new project was next, but I was at that point where nothing was sticking. These songs are from three folders from that time. They are once again kind of random names. The title of this project was originally going to be the alter ego \"personality\" of music which would be very accessible, and pop-driven. Again, I found that it seemed to be more the novelty of making that happen and learning how to do it, than what ideas it was rooted in to make that happen. So I still love the idea, but I just didn't have any music that I wanted to utilize for that (whether ones I came up with, or existing songs). The 'trip' songs (unintentionally named similarly) were from Izalea, and Bounce House. There was a folder called \"Jerk the terk'\" (don't ask; I don't know either), none of the songs from that were used. It started on Sept 7. Just demos which didn't catch my brain onto anything. Lots of good names though. That's one thing that's a bummer about my demos, they all tend to have some of my favorite names. The third folder was called \"Compressed to Fuck!\". Again, related to mixing or something? lol. Space Cadet, Tangential, and Cardboard came from this folder. It started on Sept 14. If I don't have an overarching drive for a single album at hand, I seem to write demos every time I am free after or before work, and or when I am open on the weekends. So I think that's why the folders tend to start a week apart or so. It is because the interest of the past week finished, so the next week I move onto something new to try that. On the night of the 23rd, I made three songs, one of which was Bounce It Off Someone Else First. The other two were either contrived/rehashed/not enticing, so I only used that one.\r\n\r\nSensor Tripped (both parts) was one song, but I split in two while mastering it (today, Jan 4th '26; happy new year!). It felt like a neat little thing to show the EP-like nature of this album. It's like a bunch of excerpts of nice things that happened during the sessions, while maybe not necessarily an album in concept. They were attempts to start the next full-blown project, but didn't turn out to be that.\r\n\r\nThis is the first project to be mastered with my Beyerdynamic DT 990 Pro 250 Ohm's. I was originally going to \"properly\" mix these projects in Logic, as, another thing, these were all made on my iPad (I think I wanted to experiment with that open-ended kind of creating I do on there, like my classic songs). I was sorting through my iPad the last day or two to tidy things up, and remembered I hadn't actually finished or filed away these projects yet, and I almost was going to not release them, and just hold onto them as demos. But I thought I might as well put them into a nice little bundle, and try doing some mastering on them. Learned the other night that I've been using compression and limiters wrong thus far (you need to have enough gain to actually activate them, duh), so that was also something I wanted to try. So while these are simple demos which I just kind of like, they are in theory mastered much better than much other things I've done so far, funnily enough. Gotta start somewhere.\r\n\r\nI used Linear Phase EQ for everything here too, as I learned that that works better for mastering, as Channel EQ is better for single stems. It does seem to be much more clear than with Channel EQ. Duly noted.\r\n\r\nSo maybe the mixes themselves aren't too nice (They were whatever I did in GarageBand back when I made these songs), and I bounced them with GarageBand too, so I don't know whether it was fully safe gain staging or not. But I think I remember keeping it from clipping. It's not as transparent as Logic's mixer shows you.\r\n\r\nI also was thinking, before having finished Ferret Train, that Bleeper might have worked nice for this pop idea. I think I still don't know too much about song structures yet though, so while it sonically sounds like a pop song, the structures and concepts aren't there. So maybe I will do it sometime, but it just wasn't this time. That's okay!\r\n\r\nMuch like Recreational (if I remember right), I used LUFS to measure the loudness on this one too, rather than just full scale. This seems to work much much better for consistent volume, instead of just pushing them all to full scale. If one song is perceived louder, both being at full scale is very jarring, because it sounds much louder, but they are the same volume. So yeah.\r\n\r\nEither way, all of the stuff I am learning, things are very much even more shaping up to making better projects in the future. I think it's just that I have to be aware whether I am in learning mode, experimenting mode, or creating mode. Right now I seem to be in learning mode, where I learn what I have been doing wrong, what I can do next, that sort of thing. It's not a negative light, don't worry. It's all in the best outlooks. Very happy to be able to see things in that way. It's just a list of things that you currently know how to do, and to decipher whether you actually know them, or think you know them. That's a big difference. I didn't fully know how to engage the compressor or limiter for example, that makes all the difference. And Linear Phase EQ causes less smearing from what I can understand. Yeah.",

    "about": "Literally just started this right now, as of the early morning of the 15th (the album I mean, the song was from a few hours ago). Was writing a commit name, when I thought it made sense as an album name. Here we are, the start of the next project. Never even saw it coming.\r\n\r\nEdit Sep 5: Okay, this project is \"done\"! At least music-wise. I intend to make some of my own artwork for it again, the current one with the MIC and cassette, it's just a placeholder I feel like. This one was an unexpected one, I really like it. Even more unexpected than the previous project. It seems like some of my best work is the remnant projects I work on after finishing a full-bore project, right when I think I'm out of ideas I make some cool stuff after. Then I relax and am burnt out for a bit. So it seems like this is the songs from when I started to feel burnt out.\r\n\r\nComing back some time later for the mixing of these, it really put things into perspective, the mix and masters for these are fire, very happy with how they turned out! Expanded similar learnings from the previous project, and made more improvements in general. Tried the concept I heard of mixing the whole song in full, as you hear all parts, rather than mixing each on their own. Totally new perspective, I am very happy with that idea.\r\n\r\nThe original concept for this project was to try not to use too much compression too. I still like the listening volume to be consistent though, so there are still a few limiters here and there, so I can increase the gain overall. I don't want it's brick-walled though, instead to simply remove those random painful spikes which shouldn't be there to begin with (I have yet to learn how to tame those effectively; maybe a limiter on the track bus that causes it? Seems like it's still EQ clashing issues, like bass drum with bass guitar, guitar with cymbals, snare being inconsistent in hit strength). So right now using limiters is a nice fix, albeit I know not perfect. Have only really listened to this with headphones, the only one being Dynamico I listened to in the car. Excited to see how this translates accordingly.\r\n\r\nThe EQing on invididual songs during mastering really does help a ton, I adjust the EQ for how it feels song to song, to ensure they don't sound TOO (much) different between songs, I like when they are unique, but they should kind of flow together in a way, like you don't want a bass heavy followed by a lack of bass, that kind of thing.\r\n\r\nUsed crossfades once again between songs. This time I used automation on the master bus for the mastering session, that seemingly (yay!) fixed the zero crossing issues from the previous project. That's one benefit to mastering all of the songs in the same project, it makes it trivial to have those fixed, and still have things like crossfades. So mastering in a separate step is now a likeable thing for me. It's less about mastering individual songs, and moreso for the album altogether. I am now trying to clean up less in the mixing process, and simply just make the mix good (as people have said, and now I understand). This is awesome!\r\n\r\nThis project sonically has a lot of similarities to my past work, and I am extremely happy about that. It's like I am giving proper light to that work, with a new pair of glasses if you will. How this project sounds, it's how my work from that time was *supposed* to sound. Again, I will probably say this later again about this project too, the point is that you are always growing and learning, figuring out what you can work on and improve upon.\r\n\r\nI hear parts of Electro Capacitoritor/Scary House, Carpincho, duds, zein-zein (soon to be renamed, it's the post-Reaction Factor project I have yet to fully complete). Again, can't explain how rewarding it is to let go of the process, and just let the work speak back to you. I wasn't sure if the songs here were really much to work with, but then I let myself stop obsessing over it, and said \"come back to them when you feel like you can\". And that made the world of difference. Now I have a nice little album/EP thing which I didn't really plan for. Or rather, this is what I would have hoped to have made, after finishing Recreational Outrage, but thought I wasn't going to be able to, but then it turned out it actually was, *and better!!*; and I still got some rest in to listen to new music too, maybe that was part of it. It seems like you have to give things time to breathe to let them finalize themselves.\r\n\r\nNote that these are not the extra demos from Recreational Outrage, I simply started writing things I kind of felt like writing again, after having started to make things like Griselda the Snitch. So it became it's own thing, as kind of a downhill slope of relaxation after the craziness that was the previous album.\r\n\r\nI think the taking the time to observe and understand what worked and didn't work for the previous project, that also made this one click a little more when coming back to finish this one (last night, the 4th). So that could be a big part of it, too, that I had actively figured out what I needed to adjust had I known a few more things for the previous project. And when coming back to revisit this one, those things came to fruition. This was before I had thought of the new idea to make albums of different styles and genres too, this was a precursor to that.\r\n\r\nSo this project was like when you start to realize you are on the trend of going back into learning mode/creative recovery, but you still try to keep going. The end of this project, I realized I needed to take a break, and or try something new. I ended up trying the new songs from the genres concept, but that didn't seem to pan out because of a lack of complete inspiration and or abilities to complete them to how I would be happy with.",

        "about": "8/14/2025\n\nBeen listening to some new music recently. Just picked up Genesis' \"Selling England by the Pound\". The sound of the album itself, is very inspiring to me. Alongside a set of videos about mixing/mastering I've been watching lately, I am now starting to see how to craft things to work together more nicely.\n\nSome insights I wrote elsewhere:\n\nTried to keep as much dynamics this time.\nBeen listening to music with less compression, trying to take inspiration from that\nIt seems like the way to go to get nice clear mixes is to EQ each instrument so it doesn't clash with the main frequencies of other ones (eg. cut parts of the guitars to make room for snare and cymbals; cut bass guitar for bass drum), and to compress tracks individually, rather than on the master bus\n\nAnd alongside listening to that Genesis album, it made me delve further into deciphering whether I like or dislike remasters. Turns out, the answer I seem to be going with, \"it depends\". This seems to be true, as well. Mixes are opinionated. Masters are opinionated. As is the same for the re-* counterparts. Whether you as a listener like or dislike a mix/master, that's an opinion. Same with the re* counterparts. This all adds up. So whether a remaster is good, well, it depends on, what are you as a listener looking for in the music? If anything, that is more tangible as to what you should be looking for, and it helps explain the premise a little better.\n\nIt doesn't put down the thought that a mix is \"good or bad\", in the generalization sense (of course, there are outliers, that are just tastefully bad, that's outside the scope here). I mean, some people may like or dislike it differently, it's because they have different metrics by what they determine is a good or bad mix. So it's up to you as a listener to figure out what your metrics are, and use those to determine whether the version of the album works for your needs.\n\nI very much adore the sound of the first SEBTP release (1994). However, I don't find it as \"easily listenable\". It has lots of dynamics (not stating good or bad, just an observation). To me, I think this sounds great. However, it does involve more headspace to listen to, at least from my own observation. I was listening to the 2007 remaster while playing Minecraft 1.2.5. I found it complemented the experience really well. I could hear everything, and the dynamics were great. For the original release, I felt it was much quieter, and inconsistent in volume. I personally liked the brightness of the 2007 version, along with the widened stereo field. I think having the familiar \"sound\" of how the record came across, it really helped me relate to it. Hearing the original version, I don't have as much experience in listening to that original \"sound\", if that makes sense. \"My ears don't know where to look\". I heard a lot of similar things which kind of reminded me of other bands, like Porcupine Tree, SW solo also, The Who, Opeth, and I guess to some extent Pink Floyd too. That's more of a creative similarity thing, in the sound I guess. But sonically, the mix of the 2007 one made more sense to the things I listen to.\n\nSo I think I liked it first, and I had to stick with it. Maybe in future new listens, I will do the remaster second instead. It could just be a familiarity thing too, the first master I hear, that's the one I learn it as. I seem to notice this with compression too, like MP3/M4A kind. I almost associate that with the music itself, not how it is coming across in playback. Not sure if that is what other people feel with it, but I certainly have for a long time.\n\nOkay, long story. So back to this song. I really liked the sound of \"Griselda the Snitch\", the most recent song I made (well, complete one. there were a few unused 'demos' if you'd call them that), and released. I tried to continue from that, just with a riff I started playing. I then employed the new knowledge around not using much master compression, trying to keep dynamics big, nice and apparent. Going to look into that.\n\nPart of what I have realized too, is that certain songs, mixes, masters, much like the genres themselves, they are meant to be \"musicked\" a certain way (as Adam Neely says). So if anything, maybe certain mixing and mastering styles line up with this too. Maybe people \"musicking\" differently, that has reflected why the mixing and mastering have changed as well. It could be a call-response kind of thing, kind of like supply-demand. If people aren't listening in places where dynamics are a good thing for a song to have, they mention it, and people stop having them. Same with compression. Compressed music works well in loud environments, it seems. Dynamic music works well in quiet ones. I am now conscious of this idea, in that maybe I can make music which caters to specific ones, rather than needing to be like the CSS of a website. Why does a mix inherently need to work everywhere? What's the basis in that? Just for catching everyone's attention? Or is it for it to SOUND GOOD? Whatever the answer for the scenario is, it's up to you to choose what you want. Maybe it doesn't matter to you that it sounds good. If it is meant to get people's attention, then that's that. No shame to you. It's a different way of the song being \"musicked\".",

    "about": "(This part was written when the album was started, July 20, '25)\r\n\r\nPure adulterated fun! (yes, not unadulterated). Oh yeah, and, unhinged. This is like if you see a door laying vertical (on the ground). That is a presteen example of unhinged. Or maybe a couple that are dating, they are both un-\"Hinge\"-ed, get it?? This description is a preface to the stupidity and unhingededness of this listening experience ahead. Whatever stupid joke you thought it would be too low to be, it's below that. Complete dog water humor.\r\n\r\nNOTE: This album is not done yet. Songs will be added, reordered, and possibly removed at will.\r\n\r\nThis is one of my more progressive projects in a while. I started it on the \"release date\" for it (previously, as of writing this part, it was July 20, 2025), and it is going to be at least an hour long, maybe and hour and a half. It will go in any direction, and I have yet to see where it goes yet.\r\n\r\nYes, the artwork is AI-generated. It is a placeholder, not the final product! I explained how I wanted the scene to look, and it looks very close to what I pictured in my head. I am going to use either digital or physical drawings of my own for the final product.\r\n\r\nAgain, the only constraint for this album are that there are \"no constraints\". So far, it is borrowing parts of Mike Keneally' hat. and possibly some Zappa-infused concepts too. My next premonition is that it will have some very heavy metal too, with lots of weird sounds and such.\r\n\r\nAgain again, this doesn't have to be a certain way, it will turn out how it does. However, the initial point of it's source of truth seems to be stemming from a place like Elkosaurus did. I have been very much longing to make a record like that again, and now it seems to be time. I don't know if I was ready for that kind of project again, for some time. Now I am hyper-stoked to do it. I am also very much looking to not burn out while making it, I plan to only work on songs when the time is right, and not to just spin this thing out too fast.\r\n\r\nThis is also inspired from the Boil That Dust Speck DVD and album, some of the things I learned from that really brought me back to why I love doing this. I don't know if I could name it outright yet, but it really reconnected me with my mindset from a few years ago.\r\n\r\nThis bio is on the day after these songs were made, and this is posted one day after they were made. I 'made' that artwork in May, and I think the goal for it was to be used for something like this. Seeing it again, it perfectly fits with this project and it's intent, someway or another.\r\n\r\nThis is going to be a very abrasive release. Reflecting on \"Sooth\" from Boil That Dust Speck, that was part of the start of the game for making this. It made things click again. The magic of how that song came together, that's how this initiated itself. \"Suommi!\" is kind of like an intentional reference to that song.\r\n\r\nThis is not intended to be a regular album. Don't listen to it as such. Even I don't understand it yet. So don't expect you will either. I don't know where it is grounded in, we have yet to figure it out, together. This is just as fresh to you as it is to me. I was going to wait to publish this once it was complete, but the contrary to that seemed to be the perfect thing to do. So hilariously ridiculous. I'll add the lyrics/backing notes for each of these songs to the notes for each one.\r\n\r\nI think this project is also the more-intentional start to my own lyric writing. Albeit, not ready for regular consumption, as this album is intended for (ugliness is wanted!).\r\n\r\nAnother thing about the concept for this is that it is almost meant to be a CD you'd find out in the world, which makes no sense, yet seems cohesive to what it is. A solid mystery object.\r\n\r\nOh yeah, divisive is another word for this. It is meant to represent divisiveness. The work implicitly will be divisive since it is meant to represent that as well. No drugs were present in the making of this either, or drinking. I very much value being open to yourself and not getting influence from those bad kinds of things for your mind and body. So, yeah this is purely weird in the literal sense.\r\n\r\nEdit 8/2/25: Interestingly enough, some of the songs on here are turning out to be fairly normal to some extent, didn't expect that. This is going to be a release which goes in a bunch of different directions, but both intentionally and unintentionally. So there's even another layer of 'meta' to that as well, which I didn't even intent to have, or to try, or have even thought of before. \"Haunted\" is just pure awesome. It's exactly the song I have been trying to make for some time now. I can still hear where parts can get tweaked and worked on. But the way the intent was conveyed this time, for that song, it's as spot on as it's been (some others have been the same, \"Open Ears, Open Eyes\"), this is a further progression of that progress. Just small adjustments and learning, practice, it really does get better over time. It's awesome.\r\n\r\nEdit 8/4/25: Okay, I am reminded what this project is for me. I think it's something to keep me grounded, yet to also continue to push into grounds of what I am, and what I can be, with work, practice, learning, and experimenting. It also involves me being open to making that happen. As I mentioned when working on As the Leaves Blow, I had a feeling it was the end of this project. But then I remembered. The thing about this project. It is meant to be something that's just, there, if that makes sense. It doesn't know what it is. It is unrelenting. Not because it needs to be, but just because it is. And it's what it seems to be representing. This one isn't trying to be something, and that's why it has to go the way it does. I think me allowing it to be like that is part of the journey, and that is the hard part. It's difficult to keep going forward with it, it is vulnerable to do that. But that's exactly why I am doing this. To keep going, find the vulnerable thing, and work with it, through it, whatever that may be. Progress is to be done.\r\n\r\nDidn't mean to get that deep. Okay, again, so this is interesting. I remembered part of why I am doing this. Over the last year or so I think, I realized something. It's that the things you are the most aversive to doing, those are the exact things you need to do. At least that's what I've been trying to see, trying to make choices around. Of course it doesn't translate literally to all scenarios, like \"do drugs, don't do drugs? I don't want to\". That one, that's different. You absolutely don't want to. My concept applies more to things you are less than thrilled to do. I think it's whether it's something rooted in fear or uncertainty. That's the thing that's meant to be chased.\r\n\r\nSo it's like one of those recursive things again. This album is partly meant to encompass that I think, and that idea itself is coming up in the creation of this, counteracting itself from happening. But I remembered the goal, it's to follow the things you are afraid of, and do those. So if I was afraid, apprehensive, or what have you, about making this, and or releasing it song by song, concept by concept, possibly unfinished idea by idea, than so be it. Me being afraid of doing that, it means that now that's the thing I need to delve into then. That's where the room to grow is located.\r\n\r\nSo it's not with the goal of becoming the \"always follow your dreams\", or \"wake up at 5:30 every morning to have your protein shakes, yoga, and meditation\", it's just the plain observation, in that the most growth and \"quick learnings\" come from the things you don't want to do.\r\n\r\nIt might be solely related to familiarity and that kind of thing, where you are meant to survive because of things you are familiar with. That would make sense. Either way, it is simply an emotional response you have, and you can learn to look around it, and see whether it is justified or not. Is the thing you want to do, what you want to do, and for the right reasons? If so, and it's not insanely outlandish (in the real world sense, don't be a bad person), then just go flurping do it!\r\n\r\nI think this album is also about letting go, in a way. Or if anything, just letting things take their course. You learn to trust yourself to handle things accordingly when they arise, rather than having to plan for every contingency. Ooh, maybe that's it. You don't trust yourself enough in that you will be able to handle it, so in return, you try to over-plan as a pre-response. But then you use too much energy on planning, and you don't end up getting anything done. It doesn't have to be that way! You can do it, I believe it. If you thought of it, it can be done. You got this.\r\n\r\nNot sure if it was to you or me, but I'm sure we both need it. Good luck out there chief.\r\n\r\nProbably will be back here with another edit on figuring out what this album means to me.\r\n\r\nOkay back one more time, still the same session, just 30 seconds later or so. The title is meant to represent something else too. Me being able to observe, reflect on, then state my feelings, observations, as well as allow them to fester out in the open. This album is the culmination of those. I have had my own takes on seeing how people in the world are (oh god not one of those generalizations??), and usually I try to ignore generalizations and just grouping things together, to use that as evidence for your own trajectory on things. But I now also see it as a tool for getting past your own self.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't matter whether I correctly prove or describe the world around me (kind of relates to the perfectionism thing from previous paragraphs above), the point is that I am able to speak my mind, and that I trust in what I am saying. The other counterpart to that is that one has to be open to criticism for that too. It seems like (realization in real-time while writing this), that I had not [fully?] developed neither the ability to trust my feelings, or the vocalization to speak them. I also had not been very nicely open to criticism in the past. I now see that both of these come hand in hand. I think maybe I have had trouble connecting with others, because I neither could show my internal feelings on things, nor would I allow others to change how I feel, if we did get to that point. So that's a hard way to get to know people.\r\n\r\nIt seems like some people have a certain ratio of these. The really strong people (my own analysis), seem to have both. They are open to their instincts, feelings, are able to speak them, while also being open to criticism to make things better, maybe their way was not the most ideal it could have been.\r\n\r\nWith this in mind (full circle now, the original statement I was going to make), is that I have noticed how people like \"Karens\" seem to get mad at a lot of things, and this seems interesting to me. It seems like a response, and or compensating for something, something in the equation must be missing for them to act like that. This is true for everyone, it just depends on what metric you are looking at. People that are shy, something is causing that. Maybe \"Karens\" are mad at everything because they aren't accepting things to be the way that they are, and that comes across as controlling anger.\r\n\r\nThere's even more aspects to this, I could type for a while. Will expand on this more later.\r\n\r\nIn short, the artwork feels to me like it conveys ones blindness to the beauty of the world, because they are absorbed by the things that keep them safe. Rather than letting go and just living, they need things which determine how they act. It's placing your happiness outside into things you can't control, because you are [currently] unable to gather them from yourself.\r\n\r\nThis was all driven by the term itself, \"recreational outrage\". I then took that, and put it through my \"amusing lambda\", and what came out was what I thought was amusing, the play on words of having a \"Karen\" outdoors getting angry at things for no reason. The careful pendulum between these two interesting ways to observe this, it seemed very neat to me. So that's how the artwork came about. And I think my own journey into seeing this in myself, that's why it made sense for this project. Getting used to doing things you are uncomfortable with, in the sense of getting used to doing uncomfortable things. No, you are never completely there. The point is that that is exactly what you want to get used to. You don't want to be stagnant.\r\n\r\nOkay, okay, another edit. This was the original original original meaning I wanted to denote here. It's meant to be \"detached\". This is meant to be something out of my control, I am simply letting it be what it is, and that's it. So far this bot has the goal of being, and is turning out to be, the most detached album I've ever made. I am very proud of that. I now see that simply being a conduit to the work very much does allow it to be very pure. The work itself is the strongest to what it is, it has barely any interference to hearing it from the original source material (from my head, my heart? not sure, that's cheesy though, but that's okay lol). But while this to me does sound stylistically similar to a multitude of things I've done in the past, the heart of this record is truly all new to me. I think I had tried doing this in the past, but it had not been fully apparent to me yet what it was, and what the driving force is. I think \"Catastrophic Failure as a Human Being\", \"Electro Capacitoritor\", \"Growing Into Your Potential Self\", \"Progscapes\" (still called \"zein-zein\"; placeholder), and \"RESERVED A\", they all poise a very open, unaltered, and detached point of view. Including this project, they are open to what they are, and it simply comes as it does. They didn't end up trying to be something else, and they are simply what they are. Elkosaurus almost felt like that, but it was more driven in being a certain way from the start, not simply a conduit for \"whatever might happen happens\". Songs like \"Cab Crossing\" weren't the goal to be on there, and it was a case where the conduit output that, but it was not the vision for that to be present. It does fit the album nicely, I am not observing that. Elkosaurus is exactly how I wanted it to be. It's simply not a conduit record though. This current project, this is the most conduit-based one I have had.\r\n\r\nedit next day:\r\n\r\nOkay, I think I understated or maybe misunderstood how I remembered Elkosaurus coming about. It was absolutely true to what it was meant to be, and it was exactly what I wanted to make at the time. It was meant to be \"the most outrageous album ever\". I think the difference that I was trying to articulate yesterday, but didn't get to completely distinguish, is that this album is indeed very much exactly like Elkosaurus in that it's coming from exactly what I feel like making at the time. The difference this time though, is that it doesn't have the constraint of needing to be a good or bad album. That's the difference. It's the freeing part that I wanted to bring back, in that I trusted the process. That's what seems to come and go, at times. Even if the goal is reasonable, or it's not, sometimes it's just the lack of your own trust in the process and what you will come up with.\r\n\r\nAlso, today I finished the proper artwork! It is all made by hand, very proud of how it turned out. I think it even better represents this project, to a tee. The previous artwork really did, but this one blows it out of the water. The extremely human touch is the point of it as well. It's meant to be exactly how the album looks. I think it really does such.\r\n\r\nI also started work on a song that retroactively seems to nicely correlate with the \"Karen\" on the front cover. Her name is not \"Karen\", but something else. Yet to be discovered, I will cover it more once the song is complete. Right now it's just the name (I thought of it at work), and a drum track I made right after having thought of the name.\r\n\r\nEdit 8/9/25: Hell yes! This project is done. I don't know why it's done, but it is done. That's all that matters. Just had that feeling, I am going with it. Worked last night, and this evening on the final master for it. With new ears for each song, there were a considerable amount of changes in terms of EQ and levels. I ended up using much more limiter than I would have liked, in combination with raising the gain overall, to a more consistent listening volume for the entire album. It might not be as dynamic as I originally would have liked, but I think I didn't properly handle transients previously, so I don't think there was anything I could do at this stage to fix that, other than go back and refix all of the mixes. That is not the goal here though, time to work on that next time. For the point of learning, in this stage that is a lost cause. I am happy with how it sounds, I very much enjoy this record. Going to go burn it to a CD. See you soon!\r\n\r\nMight release this with CDBaby on all platforms too, will consider that.\r\n\r\nNeed to add the liner notes and lyrics to each song, will do that next right after this post, as well.\r\n\r\nEdit Aug 11: Another point I'd like to make, is that this album is like a fully subconscious one, there's intentionally barely any afterthought in terms of having anything be a certain way. It is merely, and intentionally purely reactive. There's an impulse, it is archived, then instinctually edited to have better sound quality. Those edits don't necessarily follow any specific guidelines that are meant to make things sound a certain way. If anything, I am still trying to actively use the things I have learned to make songs better, but not use them in name. Essentially, the processes I decided to use, I didn't use them because I was \"supposed to\" (like EQ, compression, mixing, what have you), but more because they all seemed to more positively effect the experience of listening to the project itself. So while basically this whole album's creation was very hands-off in concept, it is very intimate in that it's the most exact recreation of the real responses themselves. It's understandable why not much of this album is necessarily memorable or notable after the fact, of listening to it. I feel the same way too, mind you. For what this album \"is\" (what it's make up is, what it is meant to represent, what it is grounded from, what it is built upon), it is the best thing I have ever done, because it extremely accurate. But because of that, it is not really the best \"experience\", if that makes sense. I think part of the art of making things like art, depending on their objective, say if they are meant for the enjoyment of the experience of observing it, then this is certainly not that. This is more like a raw expelling of ideas, and being able to let go of them. Not that they are good or bad, but just a way to see yourself. For some reason, this project hasn't been as amusing to me, as Elkosaurus was. Not quite sure. Maybe because I am already able to connect to it in a way. It's not as mindblowing this time around.\r\n\r\nYeah, this album is very awesome to me, because it's like it's \"accurately\" representing what goes on in the inside of my head all of the time. Inherently, if you are trying to represent that, then it's going to be messy and unlistenable to some extent. That's also why this project is interesting, because you can see why it is also crucial for you to have the ability to, not necessarily limit, but be able to choose what you want to express. This album is the entire removal of that. It's entirely instinctual. Even the ending of the album. I kind of just started feeling like \"okay, I feel like the album is over\". I was trying to think how I could end the album, what to write next for it's conclusion. But then I remembered, that's exactly the point. That's the part of your brain that this project is meant to not include. So, in return, I saw that the album was done. I had already written the conclusion, that's why it felt like it was done, complete, finalized. So that was kind of eye-opening too. Using that instinctual side of things, it's a very powerful tool to use, because it gives you answers you didn't really realize you had.\r\n\r\nEssentially, any ideas I had of what song should come next, I didn't end up using, because that would be planning it out, and that's not what this record is.\r\n\r\n[Still today, 11th] Working on publishing this to YouTube at the moment, that was another instinct I felt, that this should indeed be posted there, I felt it. That's different than it being on there because it's \"supposed to be\". If anything, my logical thoughts were that I probably shouldn't post this, because it is too outlandish, and people might not understand it (they won't; or they might, in all honesty I don't know, so I can't be sure). But again, following my instinct, I would love to post this. So I am. Hell yeah.\r\n\r\nEdit Aug 21: Listening to Portajohn, realizing that this album is meant to be entirely tongue in cheek. It knows exactly what it is, and it bathes in it. It's not being the way it is for being totally outlandish, if anything, it is making fun of itself for what it is. Or rather, it is being exactly what it is making fun of. Think of The New Black, in how it pokes fun at Strapping itself. To me, that album is very strong, let alone for the music and things like that. But I mean in that it takes the strength out of the weakness it was rooted in, and wears it on it's sleeve. This is what this album is doing. It isn't being outlandish for the fun of it (well, it is fun, songs like A.O.V. are meant to be just totally outlandish, that one is for fun). But something like Portajohn, it is meant to take the merit out of being worried about oneself perceives themself. It is the living artifact of setting aside how people perceive you. With this project, I am not worried about how this project it perceived. If anything, the reason I don't show it to people outright is because they won't understand this aspect of it. They can only see it for the silliness that it's perceived to be from the outside. So it is using the abstract intent silliness from something like Elkosaurus, and using it as a driving force to break down the worries of perception from others on the outside. For people who would understand this, and or find the silliness funny at face value, I am happy to share the whole thing with them.\r\n\r\nThe entire album front to back, sounds exactly how it is meant to sound. It is not random, every part is exactly how it is. I mean, it is \"random\" how I came up with it. But it's not like the goof-ups I made in the recording, I didn't just leave them there because I am lazy. I left them there because they represent me being okay with their existence, and moving past them. It is not for the sake of it being the most ridiculous thing ever, like Elkosaurus. This is meant to use that as a catalyst to explore being okay with oneself. Elkosaurus was the same thing, but before the acceptance part. It was testing the waters to see if I was capable of letting myself be what it was. It was a success back then. This is the manifestation of that, with progress and self work since that time.\r\n\r\nThis is the physical representation of me at the very beginning of trusting my instincts. That's why I love this project so much.\r\n\r\nI can't remember if I already mentioned this above too, but another thing is that this album is aware of the things it references, whether that's artistic influence of bands I listen to, or even self-reference to styles and songs I've done over the last few years. This isn't trying to be an \"intentional breaking of new ground\". If anything, it tries to lean into the tropes itself, like the silliness, and past riffs. It is playing fun at those, and really being like \"HEY, I see you in there!!\". So if there is a little lick that sounds like work from before, if anything, if I happened to notice that I played something familiar again, I really tried to be like \"ha, I saw you!\". It reminds me of the Zappa-related thing where he says if you play a wrong note, just play it twice. I think Wooten mentioned that possibly too, where if you do something wrong, try it again (the \"mistake\"). Make it show itself again.\r\n\r\nSo if this project is breaking new ground for me (I think it is in multiple ways, but that's besides the point), then it is merely a bonus, which I am thankful for.\r\n\r\nAnother another another thing, a lot of this is also about letting go and trusting the process. Griselda the Snitch made me think that.\r\n\r\nEdit Aug 24: Okay, another facet to this album, it is like an apocalyptic album in a way. I have had feelings like \"oh well what's the point of 'x' thing, when 'x' [excuse]\". Like, why make music when people are better at it than me, or AI is around the corner, or some other thing. There was an AI YouTube video that popped up today, and it was horrible just how enticing, yet disturbing it was. Very uncanny. That reminded me what this album is. It is grounding very heavily in reality, and or humanity. How real it is really helps bring you back from bad places, because that's exactly what it was itself, as well. When you've lost all hope, all you have is yourself, honest, human, tangible, it's really scary, but that's the beauty of it. When I have no reason to make this, that's exactly why I have a reason to make it. I am here, I am now. I don't worry about then, it's not now. I am in control of me and what I can do. I don't care if something else can replicate what people do, because it can't make me happy in what 'making' does for me. It simply creates the end result. It doesn't provide the experience along the way. That's exactly what this is, too. It's a staple to humanity, in that it's imperfect, honest, personable, and tangible.\r\n\r\nI was just now noticing I was starting to get anxious and or preoccupied with what that video did to me, and how odd it was. I tried to think of what could set me back into reality, and this album was first that came to mind. It very much described how I was feeling [frantic?], as well as allowed me something to focus on to take my mind away from that odd set of thoughts and feelings. I am human. I am me. I am in control of what I observe, consume, and think about. That's a beautiful thing.\r\n\r\nOkay, crisis averted.\r\n\r\nSo this album is also a response to the overbearing, complex, and hard to explain, modern experience of living in 2025. AI, wars, anxiety, living at home, wanting to move out (so feeling like you are doing well, but not meeting your own expectations). Rather than thralling yourself in your own despair, what are you going to do about it? Just let that shit go. It's going to be ugly, but it's worse to just hold onto it. Rather than just letting it take you out (metaphorically; or literally if you will), just let it be it's thing, and move on. So this album isn't necessarily the venting itself, or the healing. It is more an explanation of that process, a reflection of it. That's why this [album] is so open-ended in a way, because it is an honest outlook of how things felt, in the moment.\r\n\r\nI could talk for ages about this, I love music, art in the creative sense (I haven't done much with picture-related art), it is priceless how much it helps you work through things you don't know how to explain.\r\n\r\nEdit Aug 27th: heck yeah dude!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This album is up, published, and public on all platforms. I used CDBaby, it was only $15. Such a great deal. I made the release on the 10th, and it was made available on all the services and stores as of today the 27th. So just under 3 weeks. So happy this project exists.\r\n\r\nEdit Nov 25th: I think it was last week or so (or two, can't remember exactly), I heard about Kunaki for the first time. Working on getting things setup to make some physical CD releases for this project. I worked on the inside image for the two-sided artwork part of the jewel case. I realized after the fact, that while making that artwork, I was being very particular about it. As I haven't been in the same headspace this project was in when I made it, I was trying to really make sure it looked nice. I didn't end up fully liking the artwork, as I felt it didn't match the album itself. I think what it might be though, is that the image has a picture of me on it, and I think seeing myself as a representation of what this album is, that might have been scary for me. There is definitely a new vulnerability in that. A lot of my work has been a separate thing from me from essentially the beginning of doing it. Being the cypher-related naming scheme 'rBnaodn' (\"every two letters flipped\"; it was part of the scheme for a 'language' I made up when I was in middle school. There was more to the language than that, but that facet was part of it. The language was Nofth. Maybe I need to bring it back into perspective again..), or just plainly not really sharing this or promoting any of it with anyone, this album is an outlier in that I made it fully available and shared it with people close to me. I don't think they looked much into it. I'm not sure what their initial impressions were of it, and I also don't need to know nor need to worry about knowing. I am interested in that I didn't get much feedback about it though, so that is interesting as well. The people that did listen to it, they did have positive things to say. I was surprised I didn't get any negative feedback on it yet. Regardless of good or bad, I still can't quite figure out whether the work is just uninteresting to other people, or if they just don't \"get it\". Of course I made it, but something like this is totally up my alley (lol, not to sound full of myself, I sincerely promise). It must be that I just haven't made it very widely known about to get *any* reception on a larger scale. Again, not for focus of sales, streams, or things like that. I am just very interested in how it's seemingly hard to get people's attention; like good energy or bad energy. I am wondering if I want to keep it that way though. I know it's more healthy to get input from others. Internally, I still absolutely want and am striving for that. But I also know from people that did turn on that lightswitch, that there's no replacing that fuse. The magic of that bubble will pop, whether you like it or not. Once you are found, there's no going back. So I do enjoy how I am essentially, somehow, making creative work in a void. I make it without input from others, and I still make it available to people who might find it, if they stumble across it. I do worry if the solo void concept is being a disservice to others as well though, because the things I learned with all of this is absolutely something that I would be happy to share with others, it just seems like people don't see it, or they don't think it really means anything. And maybe that's not my problem. Again, I can't worry about what other people want or don't want. Only they can do that for themselves.\r\n\r\nWhat was I talking about again? Oh yeah, the artwork. So one of the pictures I saved from online was a pixelated image of a line of portapotties. I think I saved that to the project folder when I had recorded Portajohn. I felt that image would be an encapsulation of the spirit of the premise of that song. I don't know if I have words to describe the premise at the moment, will add those when I know how to articulate it. The image has a picture of me on the day I recorded More Answers Than Questions, Non-Sequiturs, and Loopage is My Friend (I am pretty sure they were all the same day? The sound of these, and the writing mindset I used were very similar to Elkosaurus as well, I think that's why they came about in the same manner as that, kind of a reference back to that by merit). I am in a fancy shirt because I had to go to jury duty, and I think I was in a good mood because I was going somewhere new, felt good at being productive, and kind of silly (again, similar parts to how Elkosaurus started; being in school felt similar). The contrast to this \"properness\" seemed amusing to me, because I was working on this seemingly absurdist album at the same time. These observations are after the fact, I wasn't specifically thinking this literally back then. And I think the guiding concept for using that picture of me on top of those \"portajohns\", alongside the low-quality of the image, it seemed like a nice gag to use that as the picture. I still like the \"idea\" of it. Something about the edited picture feels off though, kind of jarring. I can't put my finger on it. I still feel unsure about it. But back to the thing I realized the last few days, that this album was specifically to be about not critiquing the output, to simply follow it where it leads you. I think this may be another recurring lesson for that. I think I might have to include the picture, even if it feels cheeky, or jarring, or whatever other adjective that I am putting in my own way from making great CD artwork.\r\n\r\nSo, I think I am doing it. This is the artwork. That was the idea, and I made it. It does accurately reflect the album, because I made it instinctively, and I am releasing those ideas whether my inner critic agrees or not. I think I also feel like it should really be words about the album on the inside of the cover, but I also feel like I would do that because it's the \"right\" thing to do. But again, that's not what this album was for. So this is another tricky one to work through, even after having completed the album. I am going to work on understanding why it makes me uncomfortable, and try to be okay with it. It's just a silly picture. I already released the album. I am already myself, I already did all of this. Whether I put my face on the representation of it, that seems to be what I am uncomfortable with. Breaking down that barrier of separation.\r\n\r\nMaybe that's the lesson to learn here. Again, about being open to being yourself. That's what I'm afraid of. It's vulnerable. It's something to practice. It's something I want to embrace. It's something I'm starting to embrace right now.\r\n\r\nDoing things like writing my feelings through vocals, that starts here. I have to stand behind my work myself, before I feel I can use it to articulate myself truthfully. I also feel I need to learn about understanding what emotions I feel too, as I think I feel them, but don't know how to name them. I seem to be able to discern which ones they are, and help myself work through them when I sense which ones they are at the current moment, but I don't know how to articulate to myself or others what they are at the current moment. I just know (or don't know, in some cases) the remedies to help work through them, or lessen their power. I absolutely do not want to conceal my emotions, that is 100% not an option. Or rather, I don't see it as one, or don't give myself an option to do that. I know that not everyone does that, that's not my point. I know that for me that is not one of the things I am opening to do. Too much can snowball because of that.\r\n\r\nI also thought about using an image of the paper notes for A.O.V. or DOOBERB for the inside artwork, but I think that may make more sense inside a booklet if the album were to ever get one. So I think I would save it for that. The jewel cases that I'd get from Kunaki would have black inserts anyways, so under the CD you wouldn't get to see DOOBERB if that were placed there. The left panel in that event would be A.O.V. or something.\r\n\r\nGetting sleepy, and I felt kind of out of sorts tonight, mentally feel like things are up in the air. I think it's just the holidays and weird schedules. Same with routines being off too, lack of running because I am tired from working so much. Happy though, being present in the moment, and not letting other people's **** cross into my mental lane. That's their business, not mine. Empathy is great, being an empath can hold you back. I love my empath abilities, they do have a self-destruct button when used to often though, so that's what I am wary of now. Wow, the weight being lifted off by not keeping that door open ALL OF THE TIME, it's breathtaking (breathgiving?). If you struggle with that, I can't state how much of a difference it's made to remind myself that \"hey, I can take up space, too\".\r\n\r\nI hope you have a wonderful Thanksgiving and happy holidays! Will keep you up to date on getting CDs from Kunaki of this release. I haven't done shipping before, but if the random few people want to do that, I am open to trying it out. Just for fun even. Will likely only do like 10 or 15 to start (yes, CDs total), if my copy from Kunaki looks and sounds good. Just wanting to continue to try new things, learn from them, and keep making my little mark on this blue dot into a cool thing to look back on.\r\n\r\nBe nice to yourselves out there, love ya!\r\nBrandon\r\n\r\nEdit Jan 15 '26:\r\n\r\nWas reading a Reddit thread about Disco Volante by Mr. Bungle. Someone described how they tend to borrow music styles in a kitsch way. Kitsch seems to very much relate to the humor, ironic, meta, satirical nature my music and personal tastes tend to employ. So I think now I have a new adjective to describe what this album is. \"Kitsch\" has been added to the knowledge books. Just had the inclination while writing this that I should make an album called Kitsch. I think I will, how about that.\r\n\r\nI don't remember if and when I have mentioned this, in this description, or of another project of mine, but my music feels like it is trying to be if Devin Townsend, Mike Keneally, Norm Macdonald, and Patrice O'Neal worked together to make a Mr. Bungle album. The original inclination was just Norm making a Bungle album, but there's a bunch more influences than that, for me.\r\n\r\nI think my albums, now I can see at least, have a bunch of different metrics that occur throughout the playthrough. It varies in emotion, energy, kitsch-intensity, meta humor, and irony. Each of these variables can ebb and flow, and this to me is what tells the story. One of the newer aspects which I am working on fostering more, is the open/honest/reflective/hope metric. One example from this album is Pleasantries, that is the most open song on the project. Haunted is second, and As the Leaves Blow after that. Reveling in self-awareness and exhaustion is another aspect of it too, where I may want to try and stray away from recreating work I've already made similarly in the past. However, I end up using kitsch humor to ironically self-reference myself as a joke, because I am making light of the fact that I might be uninspired or running low on ideas. So repeating colors of the past are fully aware of themselves. Not because they are what I wanted, but because I have to be okay with being currently stuck. It's acknowledging that lack of inspiration, and bringing it to light, rather than trying to fake it. It is uncomfortable, yes. That's what I'm working on though. This is all telling a cohesive story, and it's documenting the struggles of things I'm working through.\r\n\r\nAn example of where this wasn't quite the case was Orange paradox. That was (off the top of my head) the last album that I have believed in the false-positive of that lack of inspiration. If I let the \"I am uninspired\" get to my head, I start to believe it, and it's ugly. Or rather it feels ugly. Say like you internally feel like you are out of ideas, so you lean into it and make an ugly album because of it. Gross. That's what that was. I think it was more the sentiment of it, more than the result. I mean the album isn't one to be very interested in, there's just not much going for it. I think the point is that I wasn't owning how I was feeling, I was pinning it up as something else, like I was trying to make this absurd album, when actually I was very much wanting to make something regular, and that contrast is what felt so bad. So the things I learned from it are that I can't make an album I want to make, I have to make an album I have to make. So instead of me deciding what I make, I have to let the album make itself. That's why I love this project so much. While it is very hectic and just kind of low-hanging fruit, it's honest to how I felt, rather than trying to pin it in that I wanted to make something like this. Does that make sense? Orange paradox was close-ended, this was hyper-open-ended.\r\n\r\nedit a few minutes later:\r\nAm reading more into it, and \"camp\" might be at play, can't decide which is which yet. My work most of the time at least is intentional in the way it sounds. The deciding factor if anything though is just that the way it sounds wasn't what I wanted to make to start with. That's when it's frustrating. That's what Orange paradox was.",

Been meaning to do a podcast about this.\n\nOh yeah, so about this song itself. With that now known, I thought I'd try recording like I used to, on my iPad, but then independently mixing and mastering it with Logic Pro. See if this sounds better or the same to you, as something like off of so, many, bad, decisions.",

        "about": "This one kind of sounds like some of my older projects. That's okay though, this album is kind of turning out to be like that anyways, as it's meant to be an any and all kind of album. This sounds really good though, and I'm not sure the older versions of this idea sounded quite as crisp.\n\nPart of the changes are that this is done with proper gain staging, EQ/compression, as well as a stereo track for the drums! Who'da thunk? I hadn't thought that maybe using my interface would not capture the left and right properly, haha. Now that is fixed. Curious if it sounds much different to you.\n\nStill using 48/24 for recording and bouncing (when the source material provides), however I am using 44.1/16 with POWr#2 dithering when finalizing the master (simply just a reencode with those specs, I still tend to be doing my mixing and mastering as I record when using solely only Logic).\n\nI also realized I could use Logic Remote with my computer on the other side of the room, so I didn't have to tear apart my whole setup over there for guitar, just leave it there, then control it wirelessly. Perfect. Couldn't ask for more. Every step is progress. That's what counts. I really like how this sounds. Mostly just a few takes for each part here too.\n\nUsing Neural Amp Modeler for the distorted tones, and the bass effect chain from GarageBand, copied into Logic, for bass. The clean guitar tones are simply just vanilla Logic plugins stacked accordingly. The drums are a Roland V-Drum kit hooked into Logic with a USB-B -> USB-A cable (adapter needed, since I only have USB-C directly on board, no biggie).\n\nYeah, this song kind of sounds like all of my ambient projects from the past year, but also in a way like Bungleow too. I think they are all coming from a similar place of inspiration somehow, to some extent. Again, might just be the tuning which drives the creativity to sound the way it does.\n\nEdit 2:07 AM later in the day: Played back the original mix/master in the car, much too quiet, and in a way too much dynamics too. Again, whoda thunk? Learning about how to keep punchiness and transients, while allowing the music to playback nice enough, without needing to turn the volume up and down throughout the song. Ended up going with automation and an Adaptive Limiter. Still a lot more learning to do in that regard. I think I might be happy with this now, just to ensure if plays back \"correctly\" on more systems. I think it was an issue with the mix itself though, rather than the mastering. Well, it's both, but you can't have a good master with a bad mix. Learning the distinction between the mix bus, compared to the master bus. I guess I thought you didn't really want to do much on the mix chain, other than for individual tracks and automation. I now see how that info could really help me out with making things sound better. I still don't quite feel totally happy with my quick automation job here, it's a bit messy, and some parts are a little too loud, but I don't want it to be too quiet either. Seems like a place to be done with it, and keep learning more and more, rather than continuing to tinker with the same project. This second edit was very much a good step though, I wasn't going to keep it as quiet as it was.\n\nI still need to master and crossfade this entire project, but only once it's done. I want the playback volume to be consistent across the entire album. Without normalization in GarageBand, and my current struggles with gain staging and compression, this is something that will be a very great thing to have in my arsenal. I am getting very sleepy now, so I hope all of this made sense.",

This has to be my \"best sounding\" song to date, I feel at least. I was blown away when coming back to it again with fresh ears. It sounds great everywhere it's played too; headphones, the car stereo, and your phone speaker. The only issue might be the arrangement, it's a little cluttered, since it tries to fit so much into the short length of the song. The solo could have been a separate section, with the backing track looped instead. But I still liked it as is, so I am going to work on arrangement for future projects. This one is absolutely awesome, and I'm super happy with it! The solo was 8 takes if I remember right, and this was #7. They were all improvised. I think the entire thing took about 3 hours to make, it was all from scratch.\n\nI actually made the artwork for this, on it's own a few months ago. Back in May I seemingly was having fun trying out a bunch of different styles with making artwork which looked \"classic\". Some of those styles have still carried through to other releases, like \"Snake Oil\", \"Trashmouth\", \"The Guest Room\", \"Renaissance\", and a few others. The concept is that it can still be digitally created, but it should look like a picture of an existing photo. Or even a combination of the two. This one kind of took that approach. Since the image was already pixelated, I had to be creative with that. Seeing this one, it actually makes perfect sense for the name of the song, and the tone it has. I didn't plan that, and I didn't plan to use the artwork for a specific thing either. They both just seem to make sense when I was looking for it, and rediscovered it. Awesome!\n\nBeen trying to think about various guitar techniques lately, and this one seems to have a lot of Guthrie Govan-styled things in the solo, and maybe even Mike Keneally to some extent. It definitely has a big Guthrie tone for sure though haha.",

The concept is that it can still be digitally created, but it should look like a picture of an existing photo. Or even a combination of the two. This one kind of took that approach. Since the image was already pixelated, I had to be creative with that. Seeing this one, it actually makes perfect sense for the name of the song, and the tone it has. I didn't plan that, and I didn't plan to use the artwork for a specific thing either. They both just seem to make sense when I was looking for it, and rediscovered it. Awesome!\n\nBeen trying to think about various guitar techniques lately, and this one seems to have a lot of Guthrie Govan-styled things in the solo, and maybe even Mike Keneally to some extent. It definitely has a big Guthrie tone for sure though haha.",

Last night I started properly adding all of my discography to my iPod so I can listen to it, and figure out things I like and don't like about how it sounds. The main things would be styles, how I pulled it off, and of course, mixing and mastering. Noticing a bunch of things, I think I am looking to go back and try some of my old styles again, now that I have mixing and mastering a bit better. This kind of calls back to a few different things I've tried in the past. Really fuckin sick, for lack of better words. This is meant to be tongue-in-cheek, like before. I miss that, going to embrace it again. This one probably is a little over-done, but that's kind of the point. Let's get back to that!!!!\n\nI have been kind of getting into a funk again with how messed up the world is right now, and I think that's why I'm getting back into making angry music again. I want to make weird music again too, I think the next wave of things will be somewhat like this. Only time will tell. I need to let some creative steam out again. I am still going to be mindfullness driven though, I don't plan to have this being the only outlet, unlike before. I am still going to come at it with the intention of making things I like hearing. Just going to let it run it's course.",

    "about": "This description is borrowed from the corresponding YouTube video of when I made this song :)\n\nDid a video of what my recording process looks like now. I am still a little anxious around live streaming, since all of it is shown in real-time. I don't want that anxiety to affect how the writing/recording itself turns out. So this one is just an OBS recording, uploaded a few minutes after.\n\nMade my own camera the main focus now, rather than the DAW. This is a big move forward in showing my confidence too, or rather, embracing it. It's me here that's the cool part, not only the music. Before I felt I was only doing a service to the teaching/recording/writing part of things. But I am an important part of why it turns out the way it does too, so changed that up this time around.\n\nUsing my iPhone camera dramatically increases the quality, looks awesome. Continuity Camera works awesome.\n\nWill update this with the Bandcamp link once I put it up there. Will have to work on some artwork for it to be a proper 'single' if you will. (yay, hello from the future! here we are!)\n\nFor this one I used a few various things, notably parallel compression, which is new to me, just read about it yesterday. I also have been using the SketchCassette plugin for 'classic' sounds, it really ties things together I feel. Adds a great atmosphere to it, much less sterile than a plain DAW recording. Using slight pitch changing is another one, this is to sound more like vinyl, where it's more 'warm'. The video doesn't have it because it introduces latency while tracking, but it is in the final master that will be on Bandcamp. It's only a few cents more, just a small hint of flavoring. And of course chorus is in here too, that's key to this 'classic' sound. Very 80s, Rush, Yuval Ron, a bunch of different people. Really have always loved this tone, only acknowledged that not too long ago. Isn't it weird when you love a style for so long, but you didn't realize you did? Huh, interesting. Same thing for me is with things like Cannibal Corpse. Haha, or rather just the crazy heavy chuggy thrash kind of thing. Definitely plan to expand on that in time too. Just really enjoying getting this tight classic tone worked out for the time being. It sounds so great I feel.\n\nThe one thing I didn't do this time around, is that I like to check my mix/master without headphones, that usually puts new perspective on certain levels, which aren't as noticeable when you have the same 'ears' on.\n\nAnd just to explain how this works one more time:\nI'm using BlackHole-2ch from Homebrew to get audio looping on macOS. I have it tied to my Scarlett interface as the input/output device. Both of those are active at the system level for my sound settings. In OBS, I am using Continuity Camera from my iPhone to get the clear webcam quality, and the audio is just the system audio present when monitoring directory from Logic. I didn't do any post-record editing for the video. There is a slight delay in the video from the audio, I want to fix that. It sounds like you can fix the chunk sizes in OBS to adjust that. We'll see. It's okay for now, it is just too dang simple now to worry about it. Not needing to do any video editing is mindblowingly cool. Super simple to set up. I am doing a Window Share of Logic from here, usually I do a Display Capture. Then you get that weird OBS infinity though, so this is better to counteract that. SketchCassette II is the plugin for cassette effects, and yes I knew my mic wasn't on during the video; that was intentional. My guitar tuning is one I kind of made up, just by ear. It is kind of a cool open chord, originally extrapolated from Open C, then I changed some things with it. It's C#, F#, B, F#, A#, D#. It's like if you smashed Alice in Chains tuning with Devin Townsend, and had hints of standard tuning in there too. I like having the 2nd string still allow for dissonant notes, that is part of my style seemingly now. And you get nice pedal tones on the lower strings. Open C is too Major for me, or rather the chords are too difficult to get dissonant notes with.",

Extremely happy with my 'new ear' for mixing and mastering. Having better tools to focus on that helps as well though.\n\nThe song thread that this is apart of is across a few different albums. I think they're either different versions of what this 'song' is, and I essentially make a new version every time I 'play' it, if that makes sense. I try not to worry about whether I am repeating myself. If something improved, then that's what I'm looking for. The quality and dynamics are excellent with this one. Very happy with it. Maybe my best work across the board. I have been feeling that frequently the last few (successful) songs, I think things have been really turning a corner, and I haven't even noticed. Going back to the original versions of this 'song' from a few years ago, this is completely better in quality.\n\nLegendale, Landslide, The Land of the Dear, The T-Shirt Nobility. There might be a few others. I think it could just be a tuning thing or something.\n\nI am heavily thinking about going back and remixing/remastering some of these older projects, now that I hear how good my new work has been progressing. I really want to make sure I am comparing the lossless versions though, as I can very much hear when something is lossy now, like when playing back with Bandcamp.\n\nThe biggest ouch is that I was exporting things while they were clipping, the last year or so, a bunch of those projects were heavily messed up by that. Just need to turn down the levels of things, rather than making the 'quiet parts' louder. Again, having better tools really helps with this. In Logic, I can much better see whether something is redlining, or needs compression/EQ. *edit: But then again, it's also probably a paradox in that I am now just able to notice it because I have been practicing that kind of work now. Also, this video is flipping outstanding. Would be great to burn to a DVD lol. Really would be great to archive. But I won't, because it's only relevant now, as the video itself states. Thank you for the outlook here! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vV00E9CwK3Q (these edits are on the 18th)\n\nEdit: Jul 14 '25, adding the artwork, making this 'single' now public! Meant to do this a few weeks ago now, at this point. I don't necessarily like this artwork, but it's moreso just a placeholder and or demo artwork anyways. Not feeling into it today creatively, I think having lots of things in the air is getting me preoccupied. Yes, the graphic on the top is a reference to Sluggo! by Mike Keneally & Beer for Dolphins.

    "about": "I wasn't going to include any information with this track. However now I feel I am ready for it (I posted this 8 hours ago).\n\nI discovered the term 'limerence' earlier in the day of writing this. It was mindblowingly shocking the kinds of things it encompasses.\n\nI am trying to understand it. I don't think it lines up completely in all aspects, but I understand and can see similar points of view and crossover with the concept here. It adds up similar explanations with things I've been struggling with. I thought I would write a song about it, without trying to 'think' about it.\n\nIt [this song] was trying to be very much 'not intentional', and simply just a reflection of what I was feeling, being in the moment. I had all of the lights off, and I looped multiple delays and reverbs together. This very far away state sounded perfect for figuring things out.\n\nAah, instinctual. That's it. This was with the hopes of being purely instinctual, unfiltered. I mean that in that this is only the one take, and improvised. Also a very pure reflection of how things are internally, it seems. Somehow. And yes there is some other processing like compression and EQ. I am working to use those to make things sound much better to my ears. I now have to learn what is too much and too little of compression and EQ. I am starting to listen in on that and learn what kinds of mixes tend to have that kind of response for me, like which ones are too much and which are too little. As it currently stands, this mix sounded perfect right out the gate, no questions asked. Any thoughts I had up in the air would just be 'perfectionistic'. This is exactly how I felt it would sound, and honestly better than I thought it could. That's all I can ask for. That means it's okay to release.\n\nI might have mentioned this before, I am looking to start releasing things as soon as they feel done. I think the goal is to be able to write songs which have the possibility of feeling complete sooner. That would be very awesome. To not need the year or more delay to finish albums, be on a backlog. If I could just finish my projects as I make them, that would be the biggest step up for me I feel. Both in terms of administratively working on them, and to their own benefit. The 'closer to the metal' they can be, the more honest to their original intent they can be. This will also make it easier for me to work on things, as I'm not looking back at the same time as I am going forward.\n\nThis doesn't have to be the end goal though, it's okay if things *need* to take time. Same with everything up to here, it is what it is. It needed to take time. If it didn't, I would have finished it sooner. Even if it's not (always) achievable, just having the goal of releasing things as they feel ready, that's the end goal. Maybe the goal is to only bring forward finished pieces which undoubtedly give that response for me. That could be a way to handle it too. There are plenty of my songs that I 'like', but they aren't what I necessarily always want to bring forth, or to listen to myself. Maybe I can use those metrics as to what I want to bring forward to the finalized projects.\n\nOkay long story concluded.\n\nThis likely will be migrated to the album cycle I'm working on right now, called \"Zoince!\". That's the working title. Not sure what it means either. This, in a way, is like releasing it as a single for that album. More of a side-effect though, not intentionally a single. It's more that this felt done, complete, and very much in the moment. Exactly something I'd want to share right out of the gate. The rest of the album still has a bit more potential and configuration to do.\n\nVery excited to show you all of what I've been working on next. Very happy with how I've been progressing. Proud of myself! Looking forward to future things to learn as well. Just got an SM57 today. Not quite sure how far back exactly, but I think since maybe Jan or Feb this year, I have had the concept of recording improvisations outside, or even in a live stream/video format. It would involve recording it like a studio project I do, but with video too. It would be out in the hills, very open and broad. Big and happy, hopeful. Grand. Not grandiose, but great. I did some demo improvisations with my electric outdoors in February (yeah maybe it was around there, that lines up about right), and I got some video too. Yet to combine those and make a proper multimedia project out of it. Working up the line of projects in the works before getting to that.\n\nI don't as much mind releasing things out of order anymore. Since it's all digital at this point (for me, right now), I can define the dates on my own anyways, and I can always just do YouTube art tracks later way after the fact (if I still want to do them, anyways, and or manually). So I can just fix the dates after the fact, and the original Bandcamp publish dates still retain the real 'release' date of those, when they were made available. I still have an internal personal timer of when those projects are 'released'. I hope to combine these into one eventually, to where the public release date is the same for me as well. That's what I want to make use of in streamlining releasing things as they are done. I think it makes it easier to move on from projects when you don't have to worry about coming back later to them, to finish them.\n\nSeeing Devy at The Wiltern tomorrow, very much looking forward to it! He deserves a well rested break. Works so hard.\n\nHope all is well, have a nice one!\nBrandon\n\nEdit*: Jul 16, 25. Coming back to this, I once again see why it's one of my best works yet. It echoes the past, of things like Septem Numero, but with hope and honesty as well. But still with a hint of unknown. That's what I get from it at least though.\n\nThis is meant to be \"musicked\" (as Adam Neely has called it) at night, in your room, in bed, with a great pair of headphones, no noise, no lights. Whatever the most safe and sound(less) place and time is for you, that's it. There should be no distractions, and you are just experiencing. That's what this kind of my writing is meant to be with. So I guess it's like a soundtrack to meditation. At least for me, this seems to be either what it sounds/feels like to me. I do like this kind of sound playing when I do what seems to be meditation. But if anything, the way this song makes me feel, that's what being present makes me feel like. And trying to explain that is such a hard thing. This does it so well, at least to what I am able to. There's only so much you can articulate which will come across.\n\nReally looking forward to making these projects into a complete album. I absolutely love the way this is meant to be musicked. I think I kind of forgot how these were meant to be listened to, and now I remember why. Not everything has to be for the car stereo, or for others' enjoyment. If you enjoy this too, then I am happy for you. But if anything, I made this for me. It is a tool that allows me to let go of the things I hold so dear and tightly to my heart.",

    "about": "If I were only including songs I think are \"good for an album\" by my current standards, this album probably wouldn't be a thing.\r\n\r\nThis is meant more for a look back to ideas and concepts that weren't part of an album goal, and were moreso just one-offs in concept, and showed what was coming up next in my writing. It's also kind of just an archive of the past in a way too, crazy that's the case now. I'm old haha!\r\n\r\nThese were all done with GarageBand on my iPhone, and I am only properly exporting them now as of recently, after having gone back and archived the .band files themselves. It's from early 2015 through to the start of 2020. Each of the dates is listed under each song individually if you are curious.\r\n\r\nYou can tell from how the writing here goes, and from the styles in general, it really does foreshadow into how my writing usually goes, and it sonically points into distant horizons that I cover later on. \"Odd Ambient\" for example was a fair ways before Septem Numero started, and looking back it sounds kind of like it would fit on that project in a way. The Guitar Improv projects were one of those too, I still tend to write in that fashion now sometimes, I just have improved my ability to listen and improvise with multitracking. I'd like to think my playing and concepts are a bit better nowadays haha. Some parts aren't too far off from how this sounds still though, so I am still feeling like I have a lot to improve on going forwards. I've felt like this for a while now, but now I am starting to notice more and more how my concepts aren't as fleshed out as I picture them to be. Now I am starting to have a stronger feeling that I want to ensure the final result is better aligned with how it's supposed to sound, execution wise and editing wise as well. I'm okay and still interested with experimenting and improvising, I just want to see if I can better hold the listener interested in that end result. If I'm writing my songs myself, and I can keep my own attention at times, then I can only imagine what other people feel. It's not wanting to cater to other's feelings, it's my own feelings that I'm not content with anymore. I guess that is a big step forward! It all starts there at least. You have to first confront yourself with your goals before you are able to change your output.\r\n\r\nMight come up with a better name for this \"album\"/\"release\", right now it's just called Classic Projects. That does seem like a simple name for this though, it just makes sense at the same time.",

    "about": "Okay. Posting this on Nov. 3, '25. Coming back to these. They are essential to where things are now. I am definitely struggling with seeing why I should post these. I think they are, once again, however, crucial to the entire picture of things. This was a categorically hard time for me. Lots of things to work through, finding what the next path was of things to come next, and discovering personal things to work through. It's the storm before the sunshine. I think having the storm visible is part of the thing here, that's the whole point. I don't know how to categorize this project really, it was just some learning how to do some new recording with Logic, and wanting to write without having a goal necessarily.\r\n\r\nThe names for most of the songs were from one of my lists of random ideas for titles. 5, 8, and 9 are the only original working names left, there were a few other tracks with names already, but as of right now I replaced them all with ones I liked more, from that list of random ideas. I think I tend to have certain periods of time where I have lots of song name ideas, and this seemed to be one of them. There's probably about 50 random little things that I had come up with. They can be thought-provoking, amusing, utter ridiculous, and or both, or all of those. Whatever makes me think twice of again, it's being written down. For these songs in particular, they didn't feel like they had names right off the bat, other than the ones I named, as this is one of those very open-ended albums. It's also very much in it's raw infancy in terms of production. Mostly just recorded it, and didn't do anything with them. Didn't listen back, just went on to the next thing. Some are like that. Coming back to them, it's really reminding me of this uncertain time period, where I was starting to see and feel a larger scope to things. That is the underlying current to a good deal of my things around this time period.\r\n\r\nSome of the song titles have really nothing to do with the tracks, namely 4. I wanted to write a song with that drum track, but I never got around to it. I like the track though, and I like the song title. They don't really fit with each other, but on their own, they very much reflect this time period, and I want to finish up these \"demos\" and complete them in a way, so just like not much thought went into the intricacies of the writing for these, the same goes for the production. This is what it is, I'm not going to be able to make it into something it's not.\r\n\r\nHorray to letting go!! 😃❤️\r\n\r\nAnother note. I never mean to use bad language for direction at people or anything like that. I don't know how else to describe when you have utter distaste for certain things, it seems like \"bad words\" like that are the only way to describe that distain towards it. It never is meant to be criticism, instead just the explanation of that \"raw emotional unrest\", which is another title on the project. When it's gnawing at you, and it feels terrible. That feeling, I don't know how else to verbalize that with words. I am learning how to get better at creatively describing those kinds of things, as right now, I seem to still be very literal in how I describe it. And I don't know quite how to merge the two universes yet, being my explorative-based soundscape descriptions, and my real-world logic side. I have trouble describing my emotions, and instead, I just describe the root of them. I am working on being able to use the emotions themselves as the vessel, rather than simply the mechanism to get things rolling. Maybe it's a good thing that I am logical-based, rather than emotion-based, in my decision-making I mean. I guess it depends on the scenario, as all things do. I definitely seem to remove myself emotionally from a scenario, before I am to respond using the emotional conclusions. We will see. Lots more things to learn. I hope this is a fun listen for you, it's kind of an amusing one to me 😄",

    "about": "This is definitely one of the releases! Heck, what even is this 😂\r\nI love it though.\r\n\r\nThis is the ~~first~~ second release that was made *kind of* exclusively with Logic Pro (Furious Buttknott was made on my phone, then I tried to mix it in Logic). If anything, I was trying to just explore new and old musical ideas again, in the context with getting used to Logic as the stomping grounds for things. That was one of the main struggles out in the beginning, just losing muscle memory for things I was used to doing. Or rather, the muscle memory I had learned with GarageBand iOS, while it translates a lot in terms of functionality (yay), how you accomplish the same features is a little different. Looking back now (Sept 29, '25), it's not even that big of a deal anymore. The things that Logic allows you to fix totally outweigh the concerns of usability I had before. But again, it's for the final polish where it helps a lot. If I am going to go improv and have fun out and about, just having the iPad and the interface really has no way to be beaten, it's too nice of a UX.\r\n\r\nI was allowing myself to have fun with it too, hence why the songs are so random, and a few just unfinished altogether. This didn't have to be a fully fleshed-out release, just a nice effort. I am very happy with what I learned during this time.\r\n\r\nThe concept was kind of meme-able too, in what the fun of this was rooted in. I mean kind of like how Carpincho was. Not that this was meant to be a continuation or extension of Carpincho specifically, but more in that it came from that same raw silly fun experimenting which is rooted in inside jokes and things like that. Light-hearted goofing about.\r\n\r\nAnd it seemed to end when \"real perspective\" started to come back into frame again, with things like \"New Sights\". I had found a YouTube video with a bunch of neat A/V concepts, so I customized it and made a sample of that, which the song is based upon. I think that channel, and maybe just myself internally, felt like I was happy and excited for a new chapter once again, while this had already kind of started over the past few albums again. Much of a recurring theme here? lol. Hadn't noticed that until now.\r\n\r\nBut yeah I think I was starting to see lighthearted music being the way forward, of something I wanted to look into further. That did end up being the case, and you will see the rest of the music from those projects surface here soon, too.\r\n\r\nI think part of the feeling for wanting to move forward, again, was in part by the new Devin Townsend books I got for Christmas, as well as it being the New Year soon. Not a \"New Year, New Me! 🤓\" scenario, but moreso that I could conceptually start a new set of things to try, by setting that landmark in time to allow it to flourish into something new. I was still the same \"me\", but with new concepts, tools, and practices at my disposal. Setting the year point as a landmark of things to actively start trying new, it's inspiring! It's refreshing too.\r\n\r\nTracks 6 and 7 (MEME!!!!!!) were going to be bonus tracks (my feeling, as of today, posting this project), but I think they do hint at the whole picture to this time period, so I am keeping them in the main lineup. The track list was a bit short without them too, so it's not like it was going to flood the length of the album. If it was already an hour or hour and a half, that would be another story. But with these two songs there too, the whole thing still clocks in at under 53 minutes.",

        "about": "[from when I posted this song to YouTube when I made it, Dec 25 '24]\n\nHappy Holidays, and Happy New Year (soon)!\n\nThis was a project I was working on today, this current album session has been fairly interesting. Logic Pro is awesome. This is like Elkosaurus Tex but with a magnifying glass. This track specifically I started on my phone, for old times sake again. I had moved to my iPad since 2022, and Logic on my Mac just about a month or two ago. Mixing is very fun, and it has been another tool to exercise making my sound more perfected. I seem to still be in the learning stage for it, because of the unpredictability of everything I've been concocting lately.\n\nGot the 'Overexposed + Underdeveloped' book by Devin Townsend, and it's awesome! Seeing how he progressed throughout the years seemed to make the creative light come back a bit again, realizing what I'm doing here. I still don't really get what I do, or why I do it, but I am reminded of what makes it fun for me, in the process itself. Sometimes I forget that part of it, and I am hard on myself.\n\nThe guitar in the beginning was the sound of the room while I was working on this, it was my dad playing his new guitar he got from a friend! I didn't ask him what song it was, I thought I would know but I didn't figure it out yet. It's probably going to be obvious once I find out.\n\nThings are going good with recording and the link, it's just been a lot of work on finishing the albums themselves, since I want to get those up and ready to go before I fully post them all here. Trying to space out my creative brain so I don't get overwhelmed and burnt out as much.\n\nThis song might change before I actually release it as part of this album's sessions, this is how it sounds so far as of today.",

    "about": "This project came about in just a session yesterday. I'm breaking the pattern of releasing things in order of when they were made (I will re-order it accordingly though, this one felt utterly complete as soon as I had finished it though, so I needed to release it now, no questions asked). I still have a bunch lined up to work through from this year, this one came about at an interesting point with dealing with things. This was also fully done with Logic Pro, no GarageBand or iPad this time around, looking to delve into learning new things. The effects stack is totally solid, that's what inspired the impromptu nature of this work being the way it is.\r\n\r\nJust earlier in the day, having just discussed things relating to feeling insecure about my music and also feeling out of ideas, after what seems to have been vocalizing that to others, I ended up making this. I didn't know this is how it would sound, and it makes me really happy to listen to. It feels very grounded or earthy or something. I will write down my guitar tuning too, I did what I had been trying on other projects this year (which you will see soon as I mentioned), where I tune the guitar to how I think it should sound (as vague as that may be), this one is some kind of flat open chord, lots of sharps in it essentially.\r\n\r\nThe stripped-back nature of this is exactly what I needed, and didn't know. There were a few other demos from this which weren't part of the session, but I had recorded with Logic also throughout the week. I think this naturally feels like the marker into using exclusively Logic from now forwards, for the time being. I had also mentioned recently to my close people that it feels like I don't know what's next in my path, but I feel like I'm ready for a change, wherever that may lead. This seems to be the uncovering of that part of the way there. I have just been feeling like, looking over this past year, it has been a great one, lots of changes, new experience, big leaps, and overall growth, continuing a positive trend in my own reflections for how things have been going. I think this premise kind of came with a down feeling, like, where do I go now? Doing that again is making it just regular, and not changing anything makes things feel like there's no meaning. Why keep doing the same things over and over again, it starts to get old? I want to learn and grow as well, and overcoming things you didn't know were in your way also seems to be a big part of this realization period, that was a subconscious part of this output too I think. It's along the path of \"you don't know what you don't know\", in the way that, how could you have done better, if you didn't have the tools or support to do it? It's also realizing that this is inevitable too, in that trying to keep this from happening isn't possible because things implicitly get passed down without one's intent. You have to know about a thing in order to prevent it from being persisted. And it involves having gotten over it yourself too, which is let along a daunting task. I know this is very obscure in what I'm talking about, but I don't think I'm ready to face this outright just quite yet, I think I am trying to work my way through it still, and understand it and how I want to handle it accordingly. It has presented an interesting set of emotions for this too, because they seem to counteract each other, and both sides of the coin seem to be tearing down walls, good or bad.\r\n\r\nI want to get over self-consciousness, working through being able to express this with vocals and words is what feels like I would love to be able to do right now, but I don't feel I have fully embraced it yet, nor have the breadth to do it without causing shockwaves. I don't feel comfortable putting my growth in more importance of possibly hurting others. Maybe this is the pleasing side of things, but I don't think this is exactly the same thing. I think respect has a lot to do with it too.\r\n\r\nLeaving the obscurity for a moment, wow I didn't realize the amount of latency that was present when using GarageBand on my iPad! Monitoring on my Mac in Logic is (perceivably) instant, and going back to try recording with what I was comfortable with, I very much noticed how bad it was. This makes so much more sense as to why sometimes I would get caught up in keeping things in time, even though I would follow the metronome to the tee, for the most part. I know I can mess up, but usually it's like a whole section of the song is just offset, and it might switch back and forth being consistently a little ahead or behind. It's like whether I was listening to the beat, or anticipating it. This disparity might be why some sections just get all discombobulated, because I start vibing with the wrong metronome, the one I hear, or the one I anticipate. Something like that. Now that should be much fixed a bit more.\r\n\r\nI think the goal for next year is yes, to continue trying new things when given the opportunity (rather than finding a way to get out of it or not try it), but to also just be honest with yourself, and observe yourself objectively, rather than consciously (I might need to re-read that sentence, just wrote it, need to figure out if it makes sense). Find where my intentions are, what I am actually trying to do, what I actually want in the grand scheme of things, being honest when trying to decide when to let go of something, and when to hold on.\r\n\r\nI think these tracks are meant to be played together as a whole, a journey of emotion and love (lol what). I picked Deflate as the main one because I have been connecting with that one the most, and I play it the most. The whole journey is great, I think that one sums it up the most though. Deflate is where we are at now, the other ones one way or another make up how we got to this point now (I think this journey is about me, but it isn't only me, that's why I say we. I am where I am because of the push and pull from myself, and because of others and how they interact with me, and also how I interact with them).\r\n\r\nFinal thing to add, check your expectations, and whether you need to have them. Do they help you? Are they realistic? With the honesty in mind, what is something actionable that will be a step forward for you?",

    "about": "Okay, this is the final installation of things, where I was trying to write, after having had the seemingly significant breakthrough that ended up being the two (three) songs on From the Void. I tried to go back into \"regular writing\" again, and I think it just wasn't in the cards. I was ready for something new. Had to give it one more shot though. Happy with the things I made during this time. I'm also glad I moved on to new things after this.\r\n\r\nThis album was inspired by a bunch of stuff, and I don't know if I could even pin all of it down, without coming back later to take a bunch of time to examine it. I haven't done really any listens to these since I made them, other than to bounce them. They also heavily suffer from gain staging issue, and EQ, compression, the whole 9 yards. That's also part of why I went to trying new things. This album is essentially me pushing 5000% through the end of knowing that it had come to an end, and new things were right around the corner. Letting out steam before opening my brain to learning new things and taking more new perspectives.\r\n\r\nBig words aside, after this set of songs was when I exclusively started using Logic Pro, as I had bought it a few months earlier, but wasn't quite ready to change my workflow over to it quite yet.\r\n\r\nB.O. suffers from a bad mix, just so bad. But that kind of gives it it's insanity, so it's okay. It might have taken away from some of the strength it had though. Some of these could use a nice remix. Don't know if I am interested in doing that, I am open to doing it, if I end up wanting to though, if that makes sense. Right now I want to keep moving forwards from here though, as this was another stop-gap of ideas in a way. I am proud with just how weird this set of songs are though. Without the intent of constructing an album itself, these songs definitely make up for a weird mix of things going on. Pretty cool.\r\n\r\nThere were 6 other songs during the duration of when these were made, and there wasn't anything notable that I liked about them (which were split across 3 unused folders, I like the concept behind one which is \"The World is Ugly\", which opens with a track \"The World is Beautiful\", then the title track of the first name is used. I don't remember the songs being notable, but I love the concept).\r\n\r\nThis \"album\" is composed from about 5 folders of things.\r\n\r\nTrack 1 was from Sept 23 2024, and it is the only song in that folder. It was called \"(bonus laughs)\", I think because the title is kind of a neat observation of randomness I had. I don't know what it has to do with the song, but it is the first title that came to my mind after having recorded it, and listening back.\r\n\r\nTracks 2 and 3 were from the second folder, and it was unnamed. They were both recorded on Oct 19. So I mostly the songs in between the first and second folder, were the ones I didn't use.\r\n\r\nTracks 4 and 5 were apparently on Halloween morning, so Oct 31 '24. That is the one with the working title \"jestershit\". I don't know why I thought of that name, nor what it means. But for an overview of this whole collage of songs (that's a cool way to put it), \"Jestershit\" seems to be the overarching theme, and a nice centerpiece to the \"normal\" parts of the album, per se. Had this album stayed in a complete heavy thing, it probably would be composed of solely things like Essential Pocket, Sporting Shallot, 'Bovine, Spatch', and B.O. But in trying to not make these songs into something they aren't, they are left exactly as they fell.\r\n\r\nOn Nov 12, I made Track 6 - 8, and they are seemingly back-references to previous releases, which is kind of cool. I think this part of the collage kind of ties things back into how it is moving on to the \"next\" stage. The following songs after these very much aid in that process, as well. I think this album (or collage rather) really does point to being a conclusion to a time period, even though some of those periods felt like they had already ended in my book. But now they are ending once again, in some aspect. It might just be a neat reflection back to the past too, to acknowledge it, and state how it was important to get to where we are now. \"Lonely Eyes\" references back to \"TragneTrake Hartbeet\" from \"Sponge, Assert, Expunge\". I'm not totally sure which songs \"Breathing Life Into You\" hark back to, but it is that kind of aesthetic from that same time period, early/mid 2023. This fourth folder was tagged with the working name \"Sigh\". If I remember correctly, this was very close to, if not the result of, a very hard day of losing a close and important family member to all of us, and I think those three songs were the response to trying to find a way to cope with having experienced that for the first time. I didn't know how to handle it, and I had to do something. I started running a bit more as well, because I needed to let the energy out.\r\n\r\nContinuing on that thread of internal strife because of situational struggles, we get to the 5th and final folder, which contains Tracks 9, 10, and 11. It was tagged with the working name \"phonemode (phonealbum)\". I think I called it that because I did some of it on my phone, definitely \"Butt Erupt\". It was the other side to the coin of dealing with internal struggles of grief and responding to sadness, it was just ugly anger at things. That's what B.O. is, just pure unrelenting release, but not in a nice way. Just like if you are running out of fuel in your car, but you just do pedal to the metal, and just floor it, just keep pushing. \"Ampersand\" was made directly after \"B.O.\", and I think it was the re-grounding after that need for release. So while totally opposite in what they are, they came from the same thing, but are two sides to the same struggle. It makes it very beautiful, looking back on it now. Anger and sadness. There's a lot more to this collage of songs than I realized, and maybe it will need a nice remix in the future. We'll see. There's plenty to work with here. Those two songs were made on Nov 18 '24. The final song \"Butt Erupt\" was made on Nov 24 '24. I think it wraps things up in a way which brings it back to a more digestible 'smaller' context in a way, not quite as in depth as some of the hard things previously covered throughout the track list. I think I knew after having made that song that what I needed to express was complete, for this scenario of things. I also knew that I was then interested in exploring using Logic Pro, and trying out new sounds, like sonically.\r\n\r\nThat means this was the last of using exclusively GarageBand on my iPad for some time. I am still using mainly Logic for the grand scheme of things (hello! This is Sept 26 '25 12am while writing this), even if I have gone back to writing in GarageBand, then editing in Logic. This project here marks the last of using exclusively GarageBand, without mixing or mastering, or anything Logic Pro to be honest.\r\n\r\nWhile I knew I *wasn't* moving to Logic to become \"a real artist\" (whatever that means), it was the last of simply not worrying about the complete product of releases. I wanted to change that. I then just started experimenting, and learning things along the way (which I will now start covering, with all of the music I made through this release up to say about Recreational, which was released immediately, and is complete as we speak, no todo work there). That is another thing which changes, and makes a lot of sense. I hadn't realized that until I instinctively tried to do it, which was to release Recreational as I thought it was finished, rather than leaving it to myself to half-finish later on. I didn't want the context of it to blur over time, like I have done with every release up until that point (this included). I now see and am glad that I tried doing that, because that is the only logical solution to getting ahead and caught up on my releases like this (since this is being released *after* a newer album to when this was written, I know, weird). The only way to get ahead is to finish newly created music as soon as I make it, and to not add it to the stack. So far it is working nicely, while albeit messy and confusing. It really helps set the bar for getting things set up again though, without having all of these branching timelines which splinter across years. I really want to solve that, and I am very much doing so.\r\n\r\n\"Butt Erupt\" kind of reminds me of \"The Midranges\" too, I wonder if that is some kind of common mental thread there, where I know I am in the middle of two things, and it's kind of a gap between the two.\r\n\r\nI actually really like these few releases from late 2024, I just want to make sure I document everything I can remember from it. That's another thing that's hard with waiting too long to release your projects, the context gets blurred with new things you are working on. It makes it hard to be in the present too, which I am also trying very hard to work on. Progress is progress though! And I want to complete all of my music catalog in being public, so I have to do it for at least a few more months of work, namely the early Logic Pro demos from the start of 2025 through to Recreational (all of those singles are not solely singles, they were songs I was proud of, from folders with a bunch of other work in there too; so lots of other contexts to flesh out still).\r\n\r\nThe artwork was also a placeholder, it was what I had used for Butt Erupt. Again, for whatever reason, the artwork seems to describe this release nicely. I will adjust it with time to make it more official. I need to make full artwork for From the Void too. And that may just be a working title for those, we'll see. I feel it might be too literal and or on the nose, I like when there's more nuance and or depth to it. That was the case with Emotional Literacy, it's way too fancy. Oincy Poincy is much better, albeit totally random. I still have to go back and re-brand that one.\r\n\r\nThere were a few other songs like \"Peeny Dancer\", which were just plain weird, like one of them where I called it \"Peven Tilson\", I think because like PT for Porcupine Tree. It used a sample of my voice saying \"Peven Tilson\" and it used it as a weird keyboard thing. More boring than intriguing or funny though, so I didn't include it. If I were to make a remix of these songs, maybe I'd include the things which didn't make the cut for this project, as I've mentioned thus far in these descriptions.\r\n\r\nThis marks the start of a new era for me, and if I'm not mistaken, that is the following project, \"Growing Into Your Potential Self\", which yes was all Logic Pro. It continues in the upward trend where From the Void, Ampersand, and Sound Bath left off, in the heart of where it comes from. It's a much more loving heart though, a safe place (actually, it's kind of like the song Safe Place too).\r\n\r\nIt's interesting, I just went back to try to figure out whether Synergy was part of this chain, and I feel like it isn't. Synergy is more like idealistic happiness, versus grounded happiness. Of course it is nice to have both as different tools for different scenarios, but I think the groundbreaking thing which some of these songs I mentioned that start with new, is that it's grounded happiness, something which I seemed to have been hard to write and or cultivate in myself. Could dive deeper into this, but I think I might have found something else to look into in terms of being able to articulate it. I think right now, as I speak, I have just found how to surface true happiness, or rather I have found things which make me happy again, and I was missing that for a while. I think it is rooted in trusting the process. Will make a note back to this later, when I have more insight.\r\n\r\nAll of this work really helps me here, and if you are working through similar things too, I hope this can feel relatable to see this process explained outright as well.\r\n\r\nCheers to the human experience! (instinctually thought of that just now, it applies nicely!) I hope yours is going well (lol what is this small talk).\r\n\r\nWatched the Karate Island DVD today, and I think I learned a lot of context about my world view, and self-view from watching it again. It has lots of inspiration in things I am working on too, so that is an awesome tie-in to that too. SpongeBob is such a great show, but not even for the things you'd think it'd be. It's the subtle lessons and hints which are inscribed in the writing and character structures, it's very beautiful.",

    "about": "This isn't really an album, I don't know what this is. It's not an EP, it's not something I intended to make.\r\n\r\nThese were two songs which were part of two separate folders of demos, and I completely fell in love with these. They are the only things from those two folders that I have any connection with at all. They connect with me on such a deep level, it's astounding. I think it's because I didn't expect to make them, and they kind of just happened. They are what I feel to be some of my very most best work thus far. Not in that it's groundbreaking or something totally new, but for how they make me feel, they really seemed to reflect a very honest side of myself which I had just discovered at the time. It's a very big, big thing. It's like when you look into the sky and see how big the universe is. However, for this time, it was when I had discovered the realization of myself, me as a person. I realized my being, and what the scope of \"me\" meant. I know you can't really figure that out into anything tangible, but I think that's why I connect with these songs so much (hello, Sept 25, '25!). It's like when you begin to trust yourself, and you see \"you\", whatever that means. This was part of that.\r\n\r\nIf I remember right, both of these songs were ones I wrote after having come home from a long day at work, slept because I was exhausted (not yet used to full time work), then woke up, and made these songs. So it was that fresh state of mind, while also being late at night. So it's like a very dream state or something, maybe that's why it felt so tangible. Not that I was able to read my dreams or something funny like that, but it's like that state of happiness or content, that somehow came across into reality, and I haven't, or rather, don't get to see that too much very often. Feathers is very much the dream song for sure, state or bliss. There are still scary parts, where there is uncertainty, but it comes back home and surrounds yourself with trust again.\r\n\r\nSonically seems similar to Up the Downstair, C418, things like that. Not intentional, just what came about.\r\n\r\nThere's something so innocent that's beautiful about Feathers, and I think that's what it's reflecting on in some way. It's when you can't really see the innocence in yourself sometimes, and this is a large reflection of the time when I was starting to become aware to that innocence, which we seem to lose touch with over the years. Not that it's not there, but to where you don't practice connecting to it as much anymore. I'm not sure if it's just not something you remember how to do, or if it's that you feel you have moved on from that.\r\n\r\nIt's like when we are no longer here, or we are asleep or something, that presence, that \"you\". That's what this is embodying. Again, not trying to sound all kooky, I just don't know how to otherwise explain how this song makes me feel, or what I associate it to.\r\n\r\nAs I write this, I thought this project would be called \"Into the Depths\". Now I think it makes sense for it to be called \"From the Void\", as that's a great description of what I feel it was derived from. That unfiltered, ambient presence that is \"you\", that's what these seem to have been created from. It's beautiful. Again, I didn't plan to make these songs, and I love how they turned out. I don't think I can make something like this without it having come naturally on it's own, so while I wish I could create things like this more, I can't expect that of myself. This was purely situational magic.\r\n\r\nNot trying to pat myself on the back, again, as I try to explain. I simply am just very happy with these songs.\r\n\r\nMost of what I wrote thus far has been about Combo Brando / Feathers. I will write about Bungleow after this line.\r\n\r\nBungleow was very much inspired by Infinity and Ocean Machine, whether intentional or not. I think that big connection to things I mentioned above, Bungleow is fraught with that as well. This seems to be that similar kind of experience that Devin wrote about for Truth. These songs seemed to be what came out of me when I sat down with the need to make them, in a compulsion kind of way. Late at night, after having napped the afternoon away after work.\r\n\r\nI haven't been totally happy with the final production sound on Bungleow, but looking back, it is another case of where I think it sounds how it does, and that's that. It very accurately conveys that message mentioned above, and that's the only goal.\r\n\r\nBungleow is like a final hurrah for a period of time, in a way. It's like a kick at the end of a race. Not that I intended for it to be the end of a period of time, but it was like a final burst of energy before the next wave of things to come.\r\n\r\nIt has a bunch of influences, namely Devin as I mentioned above, as well as SYL The New Black (I was into that at the time, new to my collection), and 200 Stab Wounds. That was new to me at the time as well. So that mix of chaos and clarity, it sums together very awesome I feel. I totally dig what happened in this recording. I have tried to go back and reference it with work I've done since then, this one came natural though. There is also the part where all of the instruments play together before it goes calm again, that part is very Marco I feel. So this also has hints of his inspirations for me, too.\r\n\r\nI feel like I may have already talked about this song in other threads of mine, I hope I have, because there is a lot of meaning behind it to me too. The heavy part that's out of random in the quiet part, that riff is a reference to The New Black, I think it's Monument? I don't remember for sure. And the silly little drum part that the guitars emphasize with the weird noise (it happens twice), it's the P.H. intro beat. I know, kooky for sure. I think it was meant to be a fun little play on things, like a little funny \"Norm-ism\" if you will, like a little funny echo in the sea of seriousness.\r\n\r\nThis song is somewhere in the chain of songs like Legendale, The Land of the Dear, ones within that. Actually, listening back to it yesterday, I think a lot of these might actually be rooted in \"Above the Roses\" by Marco, if I remember right. It's something with that, it might have been Schattenspiel and or Borrego too, I can't quite put my finger on it, but whatever it is I'm picking up on that the common thread of those contain, that's what this is harkening back to, because I loved that \"presence\" of things then as well.\r\n\r\nI guess maybe this is a counterpart to something like Feathers because it also has to do with that awareness that was gathered in that song (or time period, what have you), then it was plainly stated outright (the beginning of Bungleow), as well as then shaken to see what falls out (the heavy metal SYL/200 S.W. parts). It's like a \"I got you by the balls, now lets see what you are all about!\" kind of thing. It's not a menacing thing, but more like an \"I have the power now, what's your explanation, what are you rooted in?\", and the silly part drum beat is like a \"you think you're so funny, well I can see you plainly now, so haha, good joke\". I'm not sure what these descriptions really mean, but something about this makes sense in some way.\r\n\r\nAnd the name itself? Bungleow is composed of two things, the \"\r\nBungalow ASMR\" channel, and \"Mr. Bungle\". These two things (ASMR, and silly music as whole) helped me through some hard times, and helped me realign my compass into things that I can see, and be aware of. That's a sense of self, and the ugliness that runs through one's head, which is hard to debug because it is like a computer virus, it's disguised to appear like a regularly operating program. Your brain only knows that it's how it functions, it doesn't know that the program has gone rogue. So learning to be present and see what things run rampant through your mind, that is a large step to progressing, I feel. That's what this time period was all about, debugging how your mind operates. Looking back now (Sep 25 '25), this was the start, and or continued execution of this concept, and it really started to go into place around this time. It's becoming aware of how you operate, and whether it's intentional or not. What roadblocks are you putting in your own way? Why are you doing that? What may have caused you to do that? What can you do right now which will lend itself to helping you with that? It might not work right away, you might not even have all of the answers for these. But that's the point, you are there, and you are not working at it. Great job.\r\n\r\nGoing back to talk about Feathers a little more. I think it is essentially the \"bottom\" point of this time period. Not good or bad, but it is the hinge by things rotated upon. Not that it is the end or start of specific areas, but more like a new beginning into what is properly the next thing. After having done Feathers, and Bungleow to an extent as well, I felt something had changed. It was a new perspective, a new line of goals in a way.\r\n\r\nThis was called \"From the Void\" when I released it, and after trying to quantify what these songs came from, I think a better way to put it is simply just \"Void\". It doesn't imply good, bad, or a place. It is simply just a presence.\r\n\r\nEdit edit, while listening to Feathers (which I seem to always type as Featuers for some reason), I felt like \"Devoid of Nothing\", then \"Devoid of Everything\" would be a good title. So it is now that (I keep typing \"not\" instead of \"now\" as well).\r\n\r\nIf I remember right, not sure if this point in time whether I had started listening to it yet, but I had just started getting into Terria as well, so I think maybe that's kind of how things wrap around in some aspects. I'm pretty sure by the time I was working on the fourth folder that ended up as part of \"Jestershit\", I had been listening to Terria. I think that could have been a part of why I started delving into that \"earthy\" kind of thing again, and or it became a way that I could start seeing myself in new light too.\r\n\r\nWithin the 6 minute mark of Bungleow, those big open chords, I think in a way, the way the rhythm ties in there, and that kind of thing, it is meant to represent big breaths out as well, if anything that rhythm and flow there was meant to represent how that was correlating into my mind at the time. The big echoes of the song definitely emphasize the \"devoid of everything\" concept too, if anything, it's more that the music elicited that name though, as this was a music, and then concept kind of thing. The music spoke to me this time, before I spoke to the music.\r\n\r\nI think Bungleow has been the definitive observation of that blissful nothing kind of thing, not just as a song, but in terms of a state as well. In the line of songs I had mentioned before, this is definitely the one.",

    "about": "Looking back, this was another case where I was trying to make an album, but there were too many things up in the air, whether that's with life, or with my writing styles at the time. I think being frustrated with the results of what I was making was also part of the struggle, in that looking back now (Sept 25 '25), it was all because of gain staging issues, which resulted in heavy compression on the master bus, and possibly clipping too, but I'm not totally sure. But now I am fully behind the sound from this time period. Not because I enjoy the sound specifically per se (it sounded much better in the DAW than when bounced, but I hadn't yet distinguished this; I thought it was \"GarageBand's fault\"). And because of these records from this time period, that is what led me to take the next steps to get to where I am now, and I am very grateful for having gotten to. I also was very happy with where the writing itself was going, it just didn't have a clear vision at the time, it was very fractured across multiple different things. Again, that's okay. I think it was the tail end of my experimental works with HARRY in concept (HARRY was already done, but my liking to that project and some of the others was still present), as well as the heaviness that that record has. I think Longevity was part of the movement (along with other songs) into the bigger open sound I started getting into for probably the next 6 months or however long it was. It was from Fall 2024 to probably Spring 2025, it was a big deep dive into more things of finding myself as a person too, whether intentional or not. I don't know if I can articulate it totally yet, even to myself. But I do know that something(s) changed, moved, rearranged, and repaired themselves internally. I think I have gone over some of this on the works I have released from this period thus far, I just don't want to worry about it right now while going through the music for it. It is key to the reason for why the music is the way it is. I just can't worry about that parts of it just yet, while making these complete. It gets to heavy and or complex.\r\n\r\nThis is another \"in-between\" project. I wanted it to be a full thing, as I always try to do. It's okay when it's not though, that's part of the fun. Part of the trip has been realizing this aspect of it, too. Crucial to the process, but maybe not a landmark to stop at. More like, you see it looking out the window as you pass by. Necessary for the journey, but not something you want to admire at. I love this record still though. There are some really great songs here, and in a way, I wish they had better production and maybe a better context within a full album. But I have learned that I can't worry about that for every single song I've made that I like. It has to be the best it can be at that time, which was possible for me to accomplish.",

I don't know why JAVA LLAMA 2 inspired that name, but it's what makes sense. It's like the part of what my music allows me to do, to let go and let whatever comes come, and to let go of what happened. That's what the sound at the end of JAVA LLAMA 2 reminds me of. It's like a nice home, you are safe. So maybe this is a name which is inspired by looking back on this project.\n\nIf anything, while actually listening to this song and trying to describe what it means to me, it's how you are calmly walking along, and then things you can't (yet) control start to bubble up, and then they are there. And just like that, they are gone. This might be a description of anxiety or concerns which you can't really do anything about. They come out of nowhere, and they are right in your face. This also has a playful spin to how this is like a reference back to HARRY in a way, in that the silly/anxious thing is still there, even if obscured. Or this could also be a metaphor that it's place is going away, for the time being, like it's waving 'see you later'. Or even, just a reminder like, \"hey I'm still here, don't think I'm gone!\", like a peek-a-boo.",

    "about": "Hello as of August 26, 2025! This project is now released and available to the public.\r\n\r\nThis is kind of the segue and or end of the previous run of things. There is still some crossover with things like Trashmouth. There is a lot of information inside of the podcast portion of the album.\r\n\r\nI have been sitting on some of these songs for a month or two now, I think because they have a weight that I needed to digest a bit, and to figure out what they mean to me. Trashmouth through to this project, everything is very raw. It wasn't meant to be, but it turned out that way. Whether that's how the music emotionally conveys things, what have you. I think the lack of vision for these, that's the vision, if anything. That's what it's describing, and it does it great.\r\n\r\nI was very much going to cut Bell Dancer + Podcast and Provocative as simply demos, and just include the more straightfoward songs as the final product. But after coming back to this, I now see again how those are crucial to the point of what this project was and is, as well as what it isn't. This is another one of those projects where it is kind of aimless in a way. Trying to find something to grasp onto.\r\n\r\nI very much like the melody that occurs later on into Provocative (9:20 onwards), if I wasn't to include the whole song, it would be that part on it's own.\r\n\r\nI think including these things really hint to the direction of how things got to where they go later on, as we progress into writing things.\r\n\r\nI now recall how this was when I was trying to work on these. I very much wanted to return to the loose structure of writing I employed back when I was working on things like Electro Capacitoritor, through to A Sight to Behold. It was that loose and albeit scary feeling of letting the music take you where it went.\r\n\r\nThere must be something to me and when I write and or finish albums. I am finishing this about a year later from when I made it, and seeing similar weather to how it was back then, and staying inside because of the heat, things like that, all of that, that influences how I feel about an album at a given time. So if anything, if an album needs time to digest, it probably will take a year before I am able to feel like I am able to process it correctly. It has to be long enough where I can reflect back on it objectively, not something which is still relevant to the present (wow gotta write that down; relative to the present).\r\n\r\nSo this album is almost like a goodbye for some reason, but because it will allow for new things to come. It kind of has some kind of sad feeling to it, at least for things like Provocative. I very much enjoy that song now, looking back on it. The mix was what it is though, I was still using my iPad, and just didn't know what I was doing for things like EQ.\r\n\r\n*edit: Okay, ended up combining two \"projects\". This was done with ending at Provocative. I thought that they were two distinct things, when making them. But now looking at how they relate to each other (and the time period of only about 7 days or so for these songs), they are the same coin, if anything maybe different sides to it.\r\n\r\nProvocative is the end of the first half, Logsong is the second half. Even if this is not a regularly-composed album, this is the same \"thing\" if you were.\r\n\r\nPart of the divide is also the stress of moving to a newly-opening place, and that took place between the two halves. Logsong was on opening day, after the stress was relieved, the unknown closed. Time for new adventures!\r\n\r\nAgain, sorry for the squashed mix on this. Using auto-normalization (non-configurable on iOS), master bus limiting (not inherently bad, but paired with..), improper gain staging, and overdone EQ, these really did totally break the sound of the final bounces. Some songs are worse than others. I am glad I did all of that though, because it allowed me to start learning about how to do it properly, and it prompted me to get Logic Pro on my Mac. I started to see how the lack of tools was actually the hinderance. My heart of the mixes were in the right place, but I just didn't have the visibility to know what I was doing wrong (aka mixer would help a lot, to see).\r\n\r\nI absolutely love Sound Bath. Now that I see the entire project here all put together, it is a great way to end this list of songs. I think I had started listening to more ASMR for meditation, if I remember right. Definitely for a few later on, namely Bungleow (soon to be released).\r\n\r\nIf I remember right, again, I got home from work, I was still getting used to my full hour days, two more than before. So I would come home, and just be exhausted. I'd sleep after having tried to watch YouTube videos while laying on my bed. Without fail, I'd wake up 2 or 3 hours later, and it would be dark out. One of those nights (namely, the 5th, since that's when I recorded it), I felt like I really needed to record. It was the obvious thing to go do. Just went into my recording spot, and made Sound Bath. Maybe that's why it's such a great song for me. It wasn't intentionally, it just happened, and it was all just natural. I could venture and say it was the sleep and or relaxation that made it happen, it might have been. In a way, it very accurately feels like it seems like a dream state, and maybe that's why I like it so much. It was a very awesome huge big breath of fresh air. I think that might be why the project ended after it. I did make some other demos after it, but nothing felt like it was clicking. It's like I had already decided that this run of things was over. That's when I took a little time off from music (a week I think?), then came back and started working on Moonview (also soon to be released).\r\n\r\nLooking back to this again, I think I wanted to make something new, but I was preoccupied with the changes happening in my life (new things in the works, as mentioned around Logsong). So I gravitated back to what I knew how to do because that's what I was capable of at the time. It wasn't what I *wanted* to make, but I could, and that's what I needed.\r\n\r\nI had a bunch of random names for songs all lined up, but I only made these few. So I didn't get to use all of them. One of the names denoting a thing I was doing at the time, it was the Monomyth-ish part at the end of \"Piss\". It is meant to poke fun, and a friendly nod to Monomyth, I think it is a funny pyramid pattern I came up with while on break one day. If that part was it's own song (I think I thought of the pattern before making \"Piss\"), it was going to be called The Baconator 5000. How do I know that? In the note, it says \"(monomyth pyramid thing)\". I think when I am preoccupied, nervous, or don't have things to do, I tend to make drum patterns. At least I used to do that in my downtime when I was in school. Before starting a cross country race I would start playing drums on my chest too. It's a nervous-energy kind of thing. I have this weird whistle I do sometimes too, like a passively-playful thing, which is fun to do, albeit silly and probably annoying to hear every 20 minutes when I change tasks. It's like a mental refresher or something, just to be like \"hey, I'm here, silly thing in action!\".\r\n\r\nEdit same day: Listening to Volatile Temperaments, I am reminded how much I was listening to the debut Mr. Bungle at the time. It was definitely a marker of that time period for me. If anything, I absolutely love and loved finding that album. I think the depth of it was still so new for me, it almost might have paused my ability to create my own weirdness, it's like it filled the void that I usually try to do myself. I still haven't quite made an album to the extent that Bungle influenced me. I think musically I haven't made distinct connections to Bungle yet, because I haven't let things get to that extent. I very much would like to in the future at some point. It would have to include vocals though, and I haven't quite found the most simple way of managing that yet, because you'd need to be loud, weird, random, and I don't quite feel I can do that just yet with the surroundings I have. I don't have a place I can go to make crazy recordings without headphones. Or at least, I don't want to do it without having some place to do it dedicated to it. Same with metal vocals. That's why my old drive to work was awesome, plenty of time driving out there with not many people nearby, you could just totally practice growling and screaming, and it's just on the road. Can't really do that in town, I think it would be too obnoxious.",

    "about": "Hello! This is now released as of Jul 14, 2025. Here is some more insight which follows for this release (writing first-person, but in reality, looking back on that time period that this was made in)\r\n\r\nThis was a very interesting time and series of events for me at this point. A lot of changes in progress, and on the horizon. I think it was a major turning point for me, for a lot of things. So my own sense of self was a bit confused as to who and where I was at that current moment. I felt the most clear as to where things were at, but this at times is the most confusing for me. It's when things are in the unknown that I feel the best I think. It might even be the other way around, I can't quite figure out how to explain it. A lot of changes were on the horizon for me, and I was just stepping in to get used to them. I think this very much obstructed my ability (once again) to write clearly, and this is why it's been so fractured over the last few releases. I think the hard part is that there's not really any other way to communicate this, in terms of a proper release, because it really was driven by confusion and raw feelings. It's not something with a clear goal or intent, very open and (now I can see) responsive to the state of things at hand. I think I was also once again tired of the writing I had been doing, stylistically, and I knew I wanted to change, but didn't know where to try into next. This frustration and lack of clarity (because my focus inherently needed to be applied to the new changes at hand), means that the work is unguided in what it is. Even though the goal has been to release more listenable and straightforward works, I think I once again see how I need to release these still, even if it's ugly, and feels like a bleeding blister. If that's how it was, then that's part of the entire picture. My goal has and will be to show the entire picture of things.\r\n\r\nThis is a strong release in terms of expression, but certainly not clarity. The stark contrast between something like (excuse my language) \"Dumpster F**k\" and \"Safe Place\", it's astounding (not to toot my own cheeks, if you will), but more like, how else would I even be able to compile this into a release of this extreme nature? I don't know how to yet, other than to just let it go, and let it be what it was, in it's raw form. It feels more like something to have worked through rather than to be an ultimate statement about something.\r\n\r\nBecause of this, I now see and am starting to accept the ugliness of my releases, once again. It is what it is, things are bound to be ugly. And I now see that I have to release them in their entire ugliness, and accept them for what they are, and move on from there. That's how I can allow myself to be open and available to the \"complete, intentional\" projects I have been hoping to work on.\r\n\r\nI have to release this because I feel it will bother me if I don't. The projects that follow this one only make sense in response to this, and what it was bound from, and how it came about.\r\n\r\nIn the context of when I am writing this (as mentioned at the start, a year later from when these were recorded), I have started learning SO MUCH about what I have been \"doing wrong\" these last 4 years in terms of recording and mixing quality. It is astounding, and devastating. I had no idea about gain staging, in the sense of making sure it is not clipping or limiting at the master bus. All of my work has been doing that ever since I started. GarageBand on iOS does not make this visibly apparent, and this is very unfortunate. I also had no idea what I was doing though, so there's no question it was also user error on my part.\r\n\r\nThe last week or two I have been contemplating re-bouncing a large chunk of my catalog simply to \"replace\" the original masters, but now I see that this is counterintuitive to my goal here. Remember the bloody blister part from earlier? Exactly, I can't go back. I already made the mistake. I have to wear that now. The songs are already known for the way they sound, when I first released them. The damage has been done.\r\n\r\nThe hard part is that the masters sound nothing like how they did in the DAW, and I simply just didn't have the ears to notice that, somehow. Again, it's a thing to learn over time, it happens. I am just glad I noticed it now.\r\n\r\nLong story short (theres other nuances I could cover too, but I might do a dedicated podcast about it instead), I am simply going to rebounce only certain close-to-heart releases, ones that are important to me, or ones that I feel didn't sound how they should have when I released them first. I will release them as a second album, with the suffix \"(Rebalanced)\". I don't know yet whether I will actually remaster it, or simply fix the limiting issues on the master bus. It's just the dynamic range of the songs that's the issue. If all of the faders were turned down to not be above -0.1db total, then we would have no issue. It audibly sounded exactly as I wanted in the DAW, while making it, I just bounced them all incorrectly. I plan to do it for ones like \"so, many, bad, decisions\" (ha, what a coincidence), \"Carpincho\", \"HARRY\", and maybe a few others as well. I am still deciding if I should just wait until I learn more about proper mixing and mastering, and maybe just do that in the same go for those as well. I don't want to entirely change their character though, so if anything it would just be a remaster. I still want to at least somewhat know more about what I'm doing with that though. I don't want to mess it up a second time, lol.",

        "about": "I very much like this track. Because I was out of \"regular inspiration fuel\", I had the idea of going wild with things again.\n\nThe concept with this song was to work on it for multiple days in a row. I would come back and add new parts randomly, and it went a bunch of different places. This was meant to be a let loose kind of thing, in the vein of \"if I can't write normally right now, I might as well just have fun with it, and joke around for a bit\". It's like I felt that I can at least make \"something\", even if I don't feel like making something with a specific sound. The name is meant to be very explicit in how it explains the intent of this absurdity. Much like I mentioned the bloody blister thing in the album description. I guess this is a return to the humor around my memier-moments if you will, where the absurdity is the joke of itself. That's what this is supposed to be, once again. I think it was a return to the things like \"Rotten Swine Ligament\", \"Trailerpark Lingerie\", and \"Farm Animal Gore\". The song at the end of this project also appears to be in this same group, \"DIRTY FINGERS\". Now this makes me want to go and make a complete album of these again. I think Elkosaurus still comes out on top for being the most successful at being inaccessible. The bar could probably be lowered even more though, I have much more concepts in that regard which would be hilarious. Goofy death metal is very much a possibility.",

    "about": "Was on vacation, brought my iPad and acoustic guitar, ended up recording what would become this project. It didn't end up being too much, as much as I thought it was at the time. It was still a key part of the process though, looking back (hello, as of Aug 12, '25!). I think I might have made the art for this (as well as naming, styling, that sort of thing) a bit too 'perfected' when I released this a few weeks ago. But I think I was in the moment of doing that. This project doesn't feel exactly like the cover looks, to me. Sometimes it's messy in that regard. I think the projects from this time period were like that in general though, not really a singular point of thought like there is for some of my other projects. I am happy with the aesthetic, but this album feels much less perfected than it looks on the album art. I very much like the album art though. Much like with \"Emotional Literacy\", I feel the same way. The title and artwork just feel a bit off for some reason. It's like I don't quite know what these projects represent, even though I made them. It's like their unknown feels odd, a void or something.\r\n\r\nI might just be talking, I don't know if that is the truth now, I think I am looking too deep into this. Sometimes projects just don't have much to them, it's probably just that. It's the projects that I spend more time on, that I tend to know what they are, in the grand scheme of things. That seems to be more accurate of an explanation. And plenty of times, I still and continue to release projects which don't have much initial backing, I just start making, and that ends up being the project.\r\n\r\nI now see, that's okay when that happens. It's going to happen. It's part of the process.\r\n\r\nI think I more connect with the mystery of this album, and I think I kind of tried to not make it that. Adding these names, this title, the artwork (in how I edited it), I once again tried to make it into something that it really wasn't. Or rather, maybe I just mistaked it for what it wasn't.\r\n\r\nI more so connect with the demo artwork and title, albeit fairly obtuse and ridiculous. The artwork was a placeholder anyways, of me with my acoustic sitting on the couch, first person, my legs on the coffee table. The working title was \"Indeterminate colon muffled conundrum\".\r\n\r\nYou know what? In the spirit of making this right for myself, I have the ability to bring this back. I am going to bring back this title, and the picture. Heck to it. I like the demo artwork that's all artsy fartsy, but it doesn't work! Let's make it right.\r\n\r\n(\"Old\" name was The Guest Room, now back to the original, unexplanatory name, which feels more accurate to what this is, for some reason)\r\n\r\nEdit a few minutes later:\r\n\r\nRenamed the songs with formatting in the concept, that the ones with parenthesis didn't have names, and these are the names I \"made\" for them. They aren't the \"names\", but more like specifiers. This project feels like a void, as I mentioned. Like a place you have returned to, some kind of peace. It's not meant to be explanatory, or show something. Just a, vibe?\r\n\r\nThis project kind of feels like The Midranges to me, in where it sits with me.\r\n\r\nEdit 8/25/25: I don't remember if I even mentioned above the origins of the title for this project. It is meant to be an exaggerated way of describing when you have to fart, but you don't know if it's poop or not. That's what it means. Just to let you know, in case you didn't get it.",

    "about": "This project isn't done yet. I'm actually more happy with it the more I come back to it though. Going to refine parts of it over time, even though I'm releasing it right now. It's not just to get it out right away, but moreso because I want to iterate over it easily. I guess I release my albums like I do my software, there are multiple versions of it. Think of it like a beta stage of this album. It's not totally done yet. Some of my other albums never got to a full 1.0.0 though, that's where it's unfortunate, where the idea wasn't totally there to allow it to be a 1.0.0.\r\n\r\nI'm going to trim some songs, remix a few songs because the original exports weren't correct to how they used to sound when monitoring them in the editor, things like that. Oh, and sequencing, might change it up a little here too.\r\n\r\nEdit May 15 '25: Okay, now I think it's essentially done! Got the track order figured out (I think it's the same as the original, it turned out; not intentional, but makes the most listening sense it seems. Still using that as my main metric for how it should sound and flow, rather than 'what period it represents' solely), adjusted the trimming of some songs (extra bloat), and omitted a few songs which just didn't quite fit, or didn't feel like they added much. Even though they were part of the process that makes this what it is, this shouldn't waiver it's strength as an album just for the sake of including those. So I'm getting better at that! It's a more cohesive statement. I am very proud of this one.\r\n\r\nTaking more time with projects, I am starting to feel better about them again. It seems like I tend to let it rest for a bit (I think it's been about a year (already???) since I recorded this, and now I am just now finishing it), then I come back to finalize everything and look at it from a different point of view. I this this makes it easier for you to look at it as something cohesive, since otherwise you tend to be too close to it to review what it is yet.\r\n\r\nThere were many hiccups along the way, the main one being around Synergy. The original bounce was an M4A CD quality one, yet the rest of the project is 48khz 24bit. It's because exporting the project again with the synths it used, GarageBand must have changed their synth renderer implementation sometime between when I made that song, and when I went back (last October, maybe this March?) to bounce it in lossless. So they sounded drastically different, so much that it changed the entire vibe of it. I ended up \"cheating\" and remuxing that original M4A file, into a WAV, and upscaled it to 48k-24 afterwards. I know that doesn't raise the sound quality. I wanted the whole download to be consistent though, that is important to me. Now I see why Bounce-in-Place is a good idea for synths and mixes in general, because then they are a complete snapshot of the original, without needing the effects chain and things like that. The tradeoff is that those are no longer editable. Both have their reasons. If anything, it does make sense to try and finish figuring out all of that kind of creative stuff early on, because for me at least, I don't tend to want to change a bunch of stuff later on anyways, because then that will change what you originally wrote, which was a fingerprint of that time period to begin with. So going back with new eyes and making a bunch of creative adjustments, for me, that doesn't add up.\r\n\r\nI am still trying to decide how I might handle remixes and remasters of my original projects, as it is in a similar vein to this concept. The bad mixes of the originals are kind of the point of what they represent. It's true that I didn't know what I was doing when I made those songs. That's why they sound like that. So of course they would sound like that.\r\n\r\nIt's another thing to just plainly do another version of an earlier song you made, I do want to try that, and I have been trying that too. It is really fun! To me, that seems more like a v2 than a v1.1 kind of thing though. It's meant to be an addition rather than a replacement.\r\n\r\nI might do a 'best hits' kind of project down the line too, but with remixes/remasters of some of the favorite things I've made. The idea is to showcase the broadness of the things I've written over time, and with clarity from the new ears I can see with now (lol?), now that I'm getting better a mixing and mastering, and dealing with dynamics and EQ. I will wait still before doing that though, I see I have a lot more practice to do before trying that. I might 'try' it, but it won't be the definitive collection of \"songs we're fond of\" album thing. I want to feel more confident in my mixing before trying that officially.\r\n\r\nThis is a very solid proggy project! Seeing it now, I had really started to look into EQ and things like that, definitely by now. I don't think I was doing it really yet for HARRY/arse. I wanted to start with the result of a new album cycle, rather than changing mixing practices partway through the writing of things. I think I've done that in the past, and it kind of makes the album experience confusing, because it sounds totally different when you get to later songs in the project (Scary House for example, it changed amp styles part way through).\r\n\r\nI'll come back another point to write about the inspiration for this album, as well as the intent behind it, and what it explains. I'll have a fresh brain to document all of that. Love this one!\r\n\r\nEdit Jul 25 '25: Re-added ELLIPSIS to the main lineup, it really does add part of the context for how the flow/'story' is supposed to make sense.",

    "about": "This is the bonus extra content disc to \"HARRY\", out now! The second release for my main albums are where my demos go to die 😂\r\n\r\nThis one is chock full of insanity. Plenty of them I really liked, and really tried to keep on the album, it just wasn't working out accordingly. I was almost going to do a double-album between these two sets of songs, but I have been trying to work on making more cohesive albums at the forefront, things I'd actually like to listen to here and there myself. I can still have fun experimenting with new ideas and concepts, but it doesn't have to take away from making the main album as cool as it could be.\r\n\r\nSome of these are actually just bonkers songs, I think \"FullBore\" is the craziest I've ever made. It is as big and as fast of a song I could make in GarageBand for iOS, and I exported it at the lowest setting possible, because why not. If you zoom in on the timeline with the project open, the app will crash, every single time. You will never be able to get the repetitive part out of your head, it's sure stuck in mine.\r\n\r\nI did try to keep these all on the same album (between the now two discs), but yeah it just would've been too heavy of a listening experience. If I don't want to listen to it myself all the way through, then I imagine less other people would too. The runner ups that were almost on the main album were 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 12, 13, and 14, if I really had to trim only the other few out. But I want to try making my projects to fit onto single CDs if possible, as I've been getting into that lately, and using that as a metric for compiling my projects really helps put things into perspective for how long they are. I might make a CD for this, might not, we'll see. Elkosaurus is only 4 or 5 minutes too long, I didn't have that into perspective just yet when making that, I wanted to focus on the entirety of the project itself instead. Definitely will make one for it later on though, might remove \"Wobble Fog\" and \"Clam Chowder\" I think.\r\n\r\nThings have been going great with life lately! Not like in a surprising way, or like a lucky way, but more like a self-acceptance/realization kind of way. I am starting to see what my goals are, what they aren't, what I can currently achieve, and where I need to go to do that. Right now, making music is my way to learning how to grow as a musician, mixing, mastering, producing, distribution (Carpincho is out on all platforms!!!!), and following my gut more closely, overthinking things less. I can still overthink things, but I can also trust my gut when the time is right. I love myself and everyone close to me, and I am working out how to conceptualize my feelings internally, and also learn how to express that with music and lyrics. Words don't have to be fact, just a way to convey how you currently feel.\r\n\r\nWork your hardest out there, life has so much opportunity for us to grow into being the best people we can be! Heck yeah bro 👊",

    "about": "Yaay, this out is out!!!\r\n\r\nLooking back a year or so later (when I am releasing this now, so March 2025), I am very proud of this one. It isn't quite as fancy as I remembered it being though, maybe just because I've been working on it a lot again though. I reminds me of a time in my life when I was feeling bummed at where I was at, and the emphasis of getting over it, and working towards being more \"productive\". I don't mean that in the regular sense, but more in that you can start making your own choices for what you want, trying new things, but not because you have to or are supposed to, but because it feels great to! There's nothing to be afraid of! Try out that new skill you've always wanted to look into, stop being so afraid of everything, just take a leap and get going with it. Looking at my frame of mind back at that time, and prior as well, I have struggled with standing behind things I think, because I am really good at seeing things from more than one angle, so I tend to prove myself wrong a lot, trying to find ways to counter my own opinions with a different angle. It's like I am trying to make things more stronger, but it just holds you back if you do it too much.\r\n\r\nThis album also reflects a time when I had just gotten over the fear of having a drink too, which is what the previous album was about. I learned that I can trust myself afterall, and I just have to be honest with where I am at, and take accountability for what I might be doing, not doing, things like that. Not doing that seems to be what would result in a drink or some other kind of way to let loose.\r\n\r\nThis album was initially very uninspired and kind of sad, in a somber tone. Then as I started working on it, you can hear the tone change. I really worked to emphasize this in the sequencing as well, not to be intentionally drastic, but to really convey what was going on for me internally. It's like I stopped feeling sorry for myself, and let myself free. The madness of holding yourself so tight is suffocating at times, and if people get into your internal (head) space, you have no way to keep your responses from poking and prodding at the internal self-destruct mechanism that's ticking away (in terms of sadness and emotion, not the literal sense).\r\n\r\nThis was a very awesome and needed step forward for me. It did lead forward to an also interesting path after that, to where we are now. I started to feel like I didn't have as many ideas to write about (now we're talking about after this album, yet to be released!), because I started to feel much more guided in terms of my internal compass for myself.\r\n\r\nNow we are at a very interesting place in my writing (right now, as I am typing this), because it is much more straightforward, and experimental (compared to how I had been writing for years up to this). Now I am using Logic Pro on my Mac, I am much more interested in mixing and mastering quality, learning about cassettes, working on a multi-media live session I recorded with my guitar out in the hills on my truck, and much more free to explore things that aren't necessarily \"my thing\". This is very unlike me, and I am LOVING IT. I have been working to find a balance between doing *too much* new stuff, because sometimes it feels like you are compensating for something, like you are blinding yourself from just relaxing. So I have been working on that too, making sure to take care of myself on the everyday, rather than just doing things so I can prove to myself that I was \"good\" that day. Having a great day can be every day. It doesn't have to be every day, but you putting your best foot forward for yourself by all means will help with that to some extent. You can't control what others put on your plate, but you can choose what you can handle, and what you want to put up with. Whether that's stress, rude people on the road, or people that aren't as empathetic as you are. You don't have to be a good person to prove it to other people, just do it because it makes life easier for you, and it really does feel great. Note that it's not to compensate though, there can't be any ulterior motives, you won't gain anything from lying to yourself about your own truths. What is it you want to do? Why don't you go do it? If you don't actually want to do it, just let it go, if it is important enough to you it will have it's time and it will come back into your life one way or another. You can't do everything you aspire to do. Just choose things that you know you will be able to accomplish, to at least get off the ground walking. Then you can learn to run. Just because you can't run right off the bat doesn't mean you aren't able to. It's just not in your abilities right now. And that's okay.\r\n\r\nAlright, love you guys, I don't know haha. Just be nice to yourself, you deserve it!\r\n\r\nrBnaodn\r\n\r\nP.S. Don't worry about how bad your mixes are from a year prior, just like things coming back into your life again later: If that song is important enough to you, it will surface again in your mind when you think it's worthwhile to do it again. It's okay if the initial version is 💩",

    "about": "The name and artwork haven't been fully completed yet, so the demo name and a picture of me with Hevy Devy will be a nice holdover in the meantime! I've had this all line up and ready for release for about a month or two, just waiting on that final packaging things, I still don't quite know how to describe the work itself, other than it's intent. Thinking of calling it \"Expanses\", it was the word that came to mind when listening to Landslide.\r\n\r\nOkay, onto the original description:\r\n\r\nThe process around this album was actually fraught with a difficult set of things to overcome.\r\n\r\nSobriety has been a keen part of the household while growing up, and adjusting my perspective to turning 21 around that was the struggle at hand. Should I try drinking? What if it results in my own loss of control as well? This premise was really nagging at me, and my birthday was coming up just after I decided to end this album.\r\n\r\nThis ended up going from a kind of uninspired, goofy project, into what was a feeling of possibly losing control and or losing what I thought to know myself as, and my response towards dealing with that. I did end up trying a drink on and around my birthday, and as we had been discussing at home, it's not like the world was going to end.\r\n\r\nI think the inability to \"control\" where you go next in regards to what comes along with your age going up is what I was learning to deal with. I had dealt with this kind of concept before, and it was coming up again here. Turning 18 was another challenging one, because I didn't \"feel like an adult\". Or rather, it was like imposter syndrome. Looking younger than I am is part of my self challenge as well, so that was part of the issue. I think it might stem from me being smaller than kids in my grade when I was younger, that's just an observation though, I haven't thought about that until now, as of writing this.\r\n\r\nThis also stems into my challenge with the drinking dilemma, as I felt uncomfortable appearing younger than I am, while drinking, because people would assume that I am doing wrong while it was actually fine, since I am of age.\r\n\r\nPart of the worry of mine was also being unsure how I may respond to such \"freedom\" per se. What if I started to slip on the things that made me me, like being truthful, and or not being healthy towards myself emotionally and physically? Would I be able to uphold the morals that made me being so proud to follow in the sober footsteps throughout my teenage years, even while allowing myself to drink?\r\n\r\nI would overthink this and it was just nagging at me until the time came to pass. I am very glad to say on the other side of this, that things are okay, and I now understand that I can trust myself and uphold the values I have grown up with, while now having more things at my disposal which have the possibility to reverse that.\r\n\r\nI had started feeling like I was going to push through this, and I began running a good deal more in the early winter months when this started building up, so part of the atmosphere for this album also reminds me of being out in the hills with the cooler air, really just working hard and running.\r\n\r\nAfter trying to sequence this album like I've been doing lately, to make more cohesive projects, I just couldn't quite find the best way to sort it with it conveying the same intent that I've described here. The progression for this work around myself was messy, and trying to describe it in terms of a cohesive album just didn't make sense when I realized what this album was composed from, and what part of me it represents. It was a messy process to get here, and it didn't have a clear vision in terms of the sound or what I wanted from it. I was just working with trying to sound better at what I wanted to make, and trying to pull it off better. The vision itself didn't make itself apparent until after the fact to where I am now (Oct 28, 2024 as of writing this), and now it makes more sense what this is.\r\n\r\nNear the end of the album, I think I wrote \"No\" and \"The Winds of Change\" specifically about this situation, to where I was saying \"NO\" to what I felt like I might become if I let go and follow in what I possibly *could* become. So \"No\" is about saying NO to how you feel, like in term of the worrying and skepticism, then letting go and having things take their course. Trust your intuition in that you will keep yourself safe, and you know when you are crossing a line into something that will hurt you. \"The Winds of Change\" kind of felt like a cliffhanger in terms of the album and to where it might lead next for the next project (I didn't know what was next, both in music and my life and my personality), so it was like closing the lid of a book in the meantime, meant to be opened again when you are ready to write the next page.\r\n\r\nAnother factor in the difficulties of deciding what to do was also that I felt if I decided to drink, that \"I would be letting my knowledge of sobriety down by giving in to the drink\". Along a similar overthink trajectory to how I tend to go when I try to deal with things, I started to conceptualize whether someone could be definitively an alcoholic, without having had a drink before. It's these kinds of things that I start to gravitate towards, which will lead me to decide what I will go with next, and I have to choose whether I think my realizations make any sense, have any truth to them, or if I'm just trying to think my way out of a situation. Also unrealistically, I was concerned about whether I'd be letting my family down by \"giving in\", and that my sobriety through childhood would be lost if I chose to go through with it.\r\n\r\nI was also up to having just figured out how I might deal with this scenario, and one of the resolutions I came down to deciding it with, was that should I just \"ignore\" the concerns, and instead stay sober, not dealing with testing the waters to see what happens if I were to try drinking. The other option I went with, was to just take the leap, and just see what happens. I might as well try it now, it's okay, I have close people around me that will be able to help me get through deciding what to go next in that regard. If I had stayed completely sober, through my birthday, and to however long into the future, my other concern was that my curiosity might build to a point where it *would* turn into a problem, and I might just break, and what if I went haywire, and it turned into a big problem? I don't recall having a scenario like that before in my life, but it's still one of the overthought cases that I didn't want to have the possibility of, I'd rather know it up front and deal with it now, rather than being a \"Schrödinger's alcoholic\", for lack of better words.\r\n\r\nI think things went much better than it seemed like I was worrying about, I learned to let go of these concerns, and to just handle what happened as it comes. Allowing myself to grow into the things that come with growing up isn't a bad thing, and there is still room to try new things even while it might feel like you are leaving behind parts of what you've known to grow up with. It's actually the opposite I've found out, because I've instead turned that energy into being more self-improving, rather than concerns over drinking. My current view is that the best way I can keep it from being a problem, is to where I can keep working on myself as a person, to where it will most hopefully prevent the drink from becoming a problem. The drink is the way to cope with the issues you haven't yet handled, so the precursors are the things you haven't worked through yet. Drinking is okay in the current realm of things for me, I just have to ensure that it isn't something I use to cope with, and for it to stay specifically as a recreational here-and-there kind of thing.\r\n\r\nSelf-improvement ❤️\r\n\r\nEdit: After looking though pictures and other media from this time period, while trying to think of the album name and artwork, I also realized the other side to this coin of this period. It was also a big reflection that I felt like I was worried about becoming stagnant in life, and that I wanted some kind of change, and to try new things. I think that's part of why the songs took a new turn, being shorter than they have been in the past. Rather than going all-out on going with what I thought was neat, I really wanted to try making something more concise, and each of the songs seemed to follow that trend for a bit. So with the struggles of dealing with people you love starting to age, I felt like I had to start making more big leaps, because life didn't seem as big as it was before, and I had to broaden my horizons, like trying to apply to job interviews I had been meaning to, run more often, try not to eat as crazy as I had. Foreshadowing down the road, it's hard to do this kind of things as well though, and even while expecting things not to always go your way, I also later learned the disenchantment that you can't just \"work hard\" to get through something, sometimes it plain just doesn't work out, and you still have to keep going, even if you think your abilities will get you though. Sometimes you just aren't enough, and now I've learned that that's okay. Getting to that understanding though is challenging, and I still haven't fully accepted that internally, I work on reiterating it to myself though, as that is the most important part. This very big positive push from myself then was hit on the head with the self-confrontation of deciding what to do with being 21, which I covered above. So that duality was what this time period was about. Trying to be good at moving forward, which inherently means you run into roadblocks you left behind, and now you have to deal with again. I wouldn't have had to deal with turning 21 previously, but the concept of it had been such a distant thing to decide what to handle it like, that I didn't choose to face it until I was there.",

    "about": "I'm not sure how I categorize this one yet, it started out as turning a new leaf, making something more listenable and tangible\r\nBut then going back and figuring out which songs I wanted to use for it, it kind of goes into two separate concepts, it's still like a spacey curious album, but hints of tongue-in-cheek goofiness, and heaviness\r\nThe underground concept of the album seems to go with that in mind as well, the main song for me is \"Scopes\", it is what the artwork was meant to represent\r\nIt seems like the album as a whole kind of lines up with it too, which is interesting\r\nIt's like there's a disparity between a nice and tidy inside, safe world, then the outside of that protective wall, it's the unknown dangers of the unexpected\r\nAnd I think it might have been one of the metaphors I was wondering about at the time, and it unintentionally came into the music\r\nDo you choose to live your life in the safe, assured place? Or do you live on the outside, where things aren't assured or known?\r\nBoth have their merits, and it seems like it wouldn't be viable to go with solely one or the other, and it's up to you to decide when it's time to go one way or another",

    "about": "\"Derivative, out of ideas, unguided, and frustrated about that\"\r\n\r\nListening back to this one though, I actually kind of like what it conveys, it's like an accidental concept project. There's a few recurring themes throughout, and I think it really was accidental, just because I wasn't sure what to write really. I didn't have a sound planned ahead for this one, and I had wanted to make another new solid album, when working on Carpincho. I think I was bummed that it didn't end up being that, and I think I was plainly just burnt out on ideas by then. I had been writing a whole ton for probably about half a year or so.\r\n\r\nI had just found \"The Mistakes\", if I'm not mistaken, so the silliness around that was stuck in my head still as well. I think looking back now, I think a lot of what you write is based on what you've been listening to. It's like being an athlete, if you don't eat good food, you aren't going to perform well. Not to say that \"The Mistakes\" aren't great (I absolutely love it!), I think it's more where you energy is going, is the point of it. I think something like that album is very self-indulgent, and that's where a lot of my music seems to trend towards.\r\n\r\nBefore this project I took a little break, reluctantly, because I was bummed that I wasn't writing what I wanted. Then after this, I took a healthy break, and came back and worked on \"The Reaction Factor\". I think with that, I try to work on something that people might be wanting to respond to, rather than just trying to amuse myself with my music. It's not about catering to other people instead, but to not be so selfish with your own writing prospects. I think just having other listeners in the back of your mind for the sake of it, helps sometimes. It helps you not cut as many corners, and to just start caring again.\r\n\r\nBeen listening to the Devin Townsend Podcast / PowerNerd updates, and it's been very helpful! Learning a lot from his insights and outlooks. It helps to be able to relate on certain similar struggles in that way. I think just with the resetting of your mind every once in a while helps move things along. And it's important not to force that, but to know when it's not time, and when it's time. For me, uploading these is an example of that. I've been trending towards being out of ideas for my current sessions since February, and I'm reminding myself it's okay to be out of ideas again, that was a great long set of sessions (100+ songs to work with!), and now it's time for one of those healthy breaks. Another time will come when your creative insights will be recharged and ready for something new. Forcing it out will sound like Carpincho and this album. While I do like both of them, they kind of make me feel bad because of that, I wanted them to be something that they weren't, and that's where I am learning to change things. Looking at this one, I like it better, because while writing this one, I was okay with just tossing it aside, just to let it be one to help me move fowards, rather than having another great project. And I think learning that attitude (looking back), and the actual sound itself, it's kind of a nice summary for the last few projects in 2023.\r\n\r\nThis isn't my best album, that's not why I decide to share it in the end. It's another example of one that helps me get to the next one, which I am working to remember, they aren't all gonna be great! Hence, I think that's why I had the working name 'duds', and that seems like a great way to sum it up, as the full name itself :)",

    "about": "Coming back to this album again, I think it is still a surprise to me even though I made it. It has gone through a bunch of ups and downs, but I think it taught me so much along the way.\r\n\r\nInitially, I had plans for a big huge CF of chaos, and I was excited to make that. During the writing process for it, I ended up starting to feel burnt out on ideas though, and that really started to frustrate me, because I had the drive of making something great, but it just wasn't coming out like I thought of it in my head.\r\n\r\n\"Lucky Rock\" and \"Uke on a Uke\" were both recorded on the same day I think, and they turned out exactly how I could have wanted, and better honestly! Looking back now of course I think they have much to improve on for various things, but for where I was when I made this, it was the most accurate depiction of what I wanted to do.\r\n\r\nSo when I went to record more material after those two, I just started feeling let down that I wasn't able to write to the caliber of those. I kind of started feeling a bit lost in my music writing abilities, and whether I was actually doing anything productive with it. Just one of those snowball effect moments of having the Imposter Syndrome (funnily enough, that's mentioned in the demo song \"ßuß\". I might have been self-observant of where I was back then, and I just wasn't ready for it).\r\n\r\nThis is September 4th, 2024 as of writing this, so this album has been 'complete' per se for about nearly a year now. I think the roots that this album is grounded in were likely my own perceptions of myself back then, and how I was starting to get out of it, bit by bit. Hence similar names of \"Catastrophic Failure as a Human Being\" (gosh, that's a bit much don't you think?), I think my move forward in confidence to make things also came with a much greater imposter thing, or something like that. It might have just been tied into not feeling like I was doing enough either, or just being insecure about my accomplishments.\r\n\r\nStarting with following records later, into the new year, I worked on taking the approach of being more hands-off with things, and just letting the music speak for itself, and not have to be tied to my success as a person. Just because I made a crappy song (or a freaking BOATLOAD 😂), that doesn't mean that I'm a lousy person. Same with moving forward with life goals. It just means that you are now more observant of how you need to move forward, and you are aware of what direction you would rather be heading towards, and (hopefully) how to get there, bit by bit.\r\n\r\nSo the new consensus of this record for me, it's exactly what needed to come from that time period, to get me out of that funk, specifically by getting me in that funk altogether. Maybe it's not even this record itself that I was focusing on. More likely, this record is the representation of whatever thing I was getting through at the time, and that's what was nagging at me. I've been learning that from Devin Townsend's podcasts, which have been completely great! The music you write is how you self-reflect your feelings of things in the current moment.\r\n\r\nI still love making ass songs, I think it's comical and funny to do things that catch you off guard. I think I just didn't know that it was this record I was making, and hence it also caught me off guard, meaning it really is hella legit (lol who says that anymore). So it was so out there that it even caught me off guard, the author/artist.\r\n\r\nSo what I've learned to try is to make the thing I'm making, to the best of my ability, regardless of what it was I intended it to be in the first place. Don't take yourself or your success/goals/failures too seriously either, just try to move forward and learn how you can improve next time.\r\n\r\nNot sure if anyone else would actually want it (merch), but I think I'm going to make a single standalone t-shirt with this album's themes on it, it sounds perfectiously cheeky to where my own t-shirt of my own album to concerts, and the album isn't even that good 😂\r\n\r\nMaybe the artwork is what's turning around for this one for me, too, that turned out outstandingly to me, better than I could have thought it to describe the sound of this one.\r\n\r\nI feel like I could keep talking about music, and the process for even longer, so I'll have to wrap it up. Keep working to being sincere and honest with yourself, you know the answers to your own problems, you just have to let yourself believe you know the answer when you do.\r\n\r\nEdit Feb 23 2025: As of yesterday, I submitted this to CDBaby, and now the main 3 songs of the album should soon be available on all major streaming platforms! This is a big step forwards for me. It's not in terms of the album or music itself, completely. It's my own realization that I don't need to be doing this for the sake of sharing it to people, or getting their approval. I am doing it because I want to learn how to do this kind of thing, and I am now conceptualizing the idea behind learning how to make \"nice to listen to\" music. It's not because I want to cater to getting popular, or making things that people want to hear, but because I want to learn about what makes it nice, and that kind of thing is an interest to me now. I've been picking up some more \"streamlined\" releases lately, and I am really admiring the 'less is more' kind of sound that they have. It's not that they are doing that on purpose, but because that's their honest sound. I really admire that. I think I had misunderstood certain song sounds and styles for this reason, because I misinterpreted how the music was meant to be enjoyed, and what it meant to the artist in terms of why they made it, and what it does for them.\r\n\r\nSo for me, this is a stepping stone in allowing myself to experience more \"normal\" things in life, not because I want to do it to appease others or to get their approval, but because it's okay for me to do that, and it's starting to feel natural for me to do that. What has to be wrong with allowing oneself to not be so contrarian all the time? That's been my thing for a long time now, maybe even since I was little. I'm really curious what that stems from. I'm now learning how this doesn't have to be the root of everything, anymore. I still very much value this take for oneself, but now I am starting to see how living a multi-faceted life is very awesome, because things **really don't** have to be so black and white. I can like crazy music, and calm relaxing music, heck, even pop music. It's only a matter of exposure and understanding. The only reason you are the way you are, is because you decide to be like that, don't know any better, or aren't comfortable giving it up for something new. The only way to grow is to let something go. I don't know if that statement is really that black and white, as always it's more nuanced than that. But the concept still stands, I can be okay with letting things go, trying new things, that's what this is all for anyways right? I'm learning that my own (self-limiting) boundaries are only there because of my insecurities, and or things I don't know enough about to make decisions based on. So I have the ability to overcome that, it just comes down to whether I am able to or not, and now I think I am working towards expanding out a bit more.\r\n\r\nCassette-related content will be on the way soon, get ready for some cool stuff! Ordered it in the mail, let's see what happens.",

There's a lot more ambient jams that I didn't realize I was writing over time. I think those didn't feel like they fit into the concept of the main album. I seem to end up exploring that later on in the projects coming up next.",

    "about": "Still partially finishing up this project, releasing it as I work on it, still trying to figure out the final songs and play order. This one is very long, so I'm trying to make sure it's right.\r\n\r\nEdit February 2025: Wow, am totally realizing why this album was a total CF for me, as well as the previous ones to this. By having not kept track of the order I wrote the songs in (intentionally), this completely destroyed my way of understanding the intent of what the songs were meant to convey, and how they were to align with the neighboring songs in the project. Realized a little bit ago (I think last month?) that the contents inside of a GarageBand project don't change their dates, only the containing folder does when you re-save the project. So by opening the 'package' on macOS (I only would have discovered this from having been done trying to make this work on my iPad, where this isn't user-accessible), I can see the actual/original write dates to the individual audio tracks within the songs. This makes it possible to re-discover the ordering of the tracks, because the metadata was never lost all along! This is mindblowingly great news, as it also applies to my demos from a long time ago, back on my first phone. Again, when you open a project on iOS, it modifies what is shown to the user to be the current date, so if you didn't keep track of it beforehand yourself, it would have seemed like you lost it forever. This is not the case though, at least with my files it seems.\r\n\r\nWith this new track ordering information/intent back in knowledge, I think I can re-build the ordering for this album, and make it not such a complete disaster to how I felt it was. There's a lot of great things here, I just had no concept of understanding how it all originally felt together. Duly noted, not going to remove the ordering of things anymore, I will only do that after the fact, intentionally. I guess it depends how you write your songs though. Usually how I write the next song depends on how I felt the previous one came out. It's like an `async function* writeSong() {}`.\r\n\r\nI still need to properly go over the intent with this and the previous albums, with what went right, unexpected, and what I learned from it, what I changed afterwards, all that good stuff. Analyzing your past progress is so helpful! I don't want to get stuck in that though, I have now learned that that can also hinder your movement forwards :)",

    "about": "This one is an interesting thing for me as well. I think it might be one of my most messy albums unintentionally as of the ones I've made so far.\r\n\r\nI wasn't completely sure what the goal for this one was, and I think that showed. I didn't know where I was going next in terms of my writing. I think it's one of the low points of mine, in a good amount of areas. It's not fully something I like to listen to, other than a few parts, but I think that's also what I like about it. The fact it was not what I hoped it would turn out to be is also what led me forward in projects to follow onwards.\r\n\r\nSo yet again, as mentioned somewhere in the album itself, as well as the nature of the whole album, this is yet another paradox. Had this album been what I wanted to make, I would be happy with it. But then I wouldn't have moved onto new sounds, ideas, and concepts that I tried out later on.\r\n\r\nThe name itself came about randomly if I remember right, it was another one of those random things I came up with, and it somehow also ended up being the perfect way to describe the album and what it means to me.\r\n\r\nI actually do like the creativity behind \"Sizzelippe\", and \"Horse Scream (Ice Cream)\". Both of which were made on the Mojave Trail, as well as all of the others, except the title track, \"Toe Funk\", and \"Tumbleweed Scandal\", which were recorded at home.\r\n\r\nI think I also partially knew I had to have a stopgap project to figure things out. My writing and ideas were still a bit messy from \"Sienna\", and I still liked the absurdity from \"You Singleton!!!\". Honestly, I still really like that song hahaha (Hi! From Dec. 26, 2023). I think I managed to blend that one back into my songs again later on, which I think moved to a heavier sound in some aspects.\r\n\r\nLike most of my projects still, I hold the bad parts near and dear to my heart still I think, and leaving behind the whole picture feels like a disservice to the point of what I'm doing here, so that's why I still finish these ones out. I'm not sure what I'm doing here, and I don't really get my goal completely, but not including them also feels wrong. Yet another paradox, look at that!\r\n\r\n\"Horse Scream (Ice Cream)\" was another step forward for me, even for a silly song like that. I think it was the sonic quality of it. It started with the synth parts on my phone, then when I was back at home and could record with the song, I added the guitars in hopes of making the song \"worse-ish\", by making it unexpectedly heavy, since it didn't sound like it needed to be initially. I thought that contrast was funnily cool. Having experimented a little more on double-tracking with that, and some more panning/improved mixing, I really liked how much more filled-out it sounded, and I think that concept moved forward in inspiration for writing future songs, which is something I really do try and handle properly for more fleshed-out feeling songs. If I think a song is going somewhere, now I have been trying expand it with a little more wind in it's sails, make it something broader to listen to. I had done this with previous songs in the past as well, but not so as much with the more improvised works. Usually it was something shorter and riff-based. I realized I should try to do this with my longer songs as well, and to not have only a few single tracks for the final thing. Just having a better fleshed out mix and panning can do wonders to a song when it's only in the \"potential\" stage.\r\n\r\nAfter having written the title song, I wasn't sure it was anything meaningful. Listening to it again now while writing this, it does point to the future a little bit, as well as back to the past in some spots.\r\n\r\nI think while I don't fully like this project in a few different ways, I really found what I wanted to do next from it, because it showed me what I didn't like what I was doing. It's like how learning to do things the wrong way teaches you to do things the right way, that's an example of this lol.\r\n\r\nSure a fun journey!\r\n\r\nI guess another thing I can mention is I think this was partially inspired by the craziness from Mike Keneally's work, but I feel like I didn't do it justice. I'm not sure. His goes all kind of different places, but you can tell of his confidence and charisma in making it. For this one, I don't think I was fully committed to the sound, or rather I wasn't sure if it was what I was going for.\r\n\r\nSo maybe it's not the work itself I'm criticizing here, but rather my own reflection of whether I felt confident in what I was making. It's a combination of that, as well as knowing what you wanted to make. It's the ability to make the work you do make, and to be able to stand behind it and say it's yours, and not be afraid of it. It also spurs down to my early projects like Elkosaurus where I intentionally wanted it to be bad. I think I wasn't confident in making something to my 100% at the time, so I didn't feel ready in being able to pull that off. I'm really glad that project happened as well, because I learned that not everything has to be perfect and just right. I think that's also part of why I didn't want to try my \"100%\" at a project, because I was going to work it to death in making it perfect, and I didn't yet know how to \"just let things go\". So I'm glad that I stepped over that boundary, because it has allowed me to do so much over the last few years (2 years now???).\r\n\r\nI think this also comes back around to this project. I had become so used to accepting anything came my way in terms of quality and sound of my creativity, that I was starting to feel sick of hearing the \"garbage\" parts being left in. For the next project after this one, I wanted to continue writing a lot, but to allow me to have a much larger queue of great songs to choose from. I didn't want to keep the bad ones if they were just \"alright\". Throw out some of that picture of the whole thing, it's ok! Rather than having 3 albums/EPs with marginal songs mixed in with some gems, why not just work on the concept for a bit longer, and only keep the songs you really love? That's what I'm looking forward to show you over the next remaining projects from this year. I am actually looking forward to listening to those normally in the car!\r\n\r\nLots to say for this one, I can probably keep going. Gotta post this so I can move onto the next one though! My goal last year was to hopefully finish and upload all of my music up to what I had been writing, I'm almost there! These final projects are much bigger than this and the ones before it, so I think I am proud to say I moved a heck of a lot forward on that. It's okay if these last few go over after New Years, because I would rather ensure they are the great albums I hope they can be (hence recording more songs to pick better ones from), than to have it up in time, for the sake of completing my \"resolution\". I mainly had the resolution to get started on this anyways, since it was getting heavily worse with each new album I did. Adding more music to work on over time was getting both stressful to keep track of, as well as it being something I needed to come back and recount later. Going into 2024, I will be caught up on all of my projects again, since about 2020-21. I plan on releasing things in a timely fashion in relation to when I actually complete them, one at a time like a sane person would likely do. I will like to keep trying to make as many as I need to (need? this is a great outlet for me!) throughout the year, so I don't plan on trying to slow down on the concepts and releases or anything, but rather to complete and properly release things as they are finished, than leaving it to be handled by future me later. After these are all caught up, it may be fun to draw a chart of how messy this whole shebang was, to see where the projects were released in contrast to when they were made and or completed.\r\n\r\nFor reference, just last year, I was finishing up \"Corruption Junction\". That makes this the *20th* thing I've released/completed this year. I don't like number things like that, I'm not looking for a status with that. It's more a metric for myself to remind me to chillax a bit, because that's just ridiculous. I stress out about things being one way or another, I work on reminding myself it's alright.",

    "about": "This one was a bit of a mess honestly. I think I tried to let loose a bit again with this one, trying to make new kinds of sounds. Some parts really shine through, and I really like them. But others are just a bit sloppy I think. I kind of had a love-hate for this one, because when I started working on it, I wanted it to be a nice and clean album, but it's actually really gritty and dirty I think haha. But looking back on it as I post it, I think it's actually a very solid set of songs.\r\n\r\n'Frogdad' wasn't going to be as experimental initially, it kind of just evolved into that. I think that kind of disappointed me initially once I finished it, because I thought I had taken the 'easy road' out again, by just goofing off rather than trying to make something tangibly nice. I think that's part of my love-hate relationship with my goofy sound, having made a lot more music since starting it. Now I think I know how to accept it, I just have to do it in combination with other songs with a more conceptual take. This album actually does that really well, thanks to songs like 'Carnigee Mellón', 'Spaghetti Nightmare' to some extent (it's a bit wild in some ways too hehe, I think it's a nice cross between the two, in a single song), and 'Fading Off Into Silence'. The last two songs were really one, and I had already planned on having them be two sections. Bandcamp didn't let that big of a single song to upload, so I ended up properly making them into two, rather than having a double-name. 'You Singleton!!!' is absolutely one of my favorites, that turned out miles better than I intended. I think I like what's going on there. I come back again to expand on that concept in future projects up. 'Loveland' turned out nice, but I was hoping it would've been more than it was. I think I didn't quite know the plan for that one when I made it, so it was a bit messy unintentionally, and I think that's what bugs me. I wish 'Trailerpark Lingerie' was a bit more also, the concept for that one was good haha. I wanted to make just a revolting song, hence the name. I didn't really know how to expand on it, I may come back to it again later on to finish that concept out. I think it relates to the absurdity of 'Farm Animal Gore' and songs like that, where they are essentially just meant to be putrid in nature. Oh yeah, and I know how lingerie is pronounced, but I kind of internally pronounce it 'linguree' just for the sake of it. Oh yeah and 'Carnigee Mellón' is another one of my broken analogies of some sort. Same with 'Frogdad' and 'Spaghetti Nightmare'. 'Ghost's Revival' is a reference to what I thought Opeth's Ghost Reveries was called. I think I had just found and been listening to Blackwater Park around this album and the previous one.\r\n\r\nThere were also a few other entertaining demos from these sessions, but the small bits that I do like aren't worth adding another 10 or 20 minutes of fluff just to get to those parts. I'm trying to limit the amount of fluff I keep through to the final result of my projects. It's still happening a bit for me I think, it just depends on the nature of the project I feel. If there's a concept I like, even if I didn't execute it fully, I'll usually try to keep it around if it isn't too burdensome to the listening experience. I had a few of those which I feel I should have probably trimmed out from projects like 'A Sight to Behold' and 'Scary House', which I think could've been much shorter and more streamlined without those in there. But since it was getting time-wise further away from when I actually made the project, I didn't want to filter everything out that made the project what it was. That's less of a problem as I finally catch up on my music, because I am trying to plan for not including fluff from the start, and I am getting a better idea as to what might be fluff before recording it. Or rather, if it isn't going anywhere, then I don't want to keep it around, even if it might be a good concept. I'm trying to focus on execution and completeness going forward. I also started (in projects coming up) just trying to make more, hence allowing me to drop more cruft, and have a bigger collection of better things, so it can still be a big project, but not have filler for the sake of it. I try to notice if it's a song I just want to skip. If it is, then it probably shouldn't be included in the final project.",

    "about": "This one was a fun mix of songs, maybe almost a little too much. It also felt less unguided, similar to the last two projects. I wanted to improve my writing practices/creative decisions quality, but there wasn't a specific direction for the album. I think that sometimes can make things a challenge, when you want something new, but you aren't (initially) happy with what you've done. Coming back to it later, these songs are a continued step up in focus compared to my previous projects I think, and I'm really happy with that. It's okay that I wasn't completely sold on it at first, or that it didn't have an initial plan to start things off, sometimes that's exactly what you need. I ran into this again about a month ago (this is Nov. 2023 me writing here), and that let me start working on this 'The Reaction Factor' project, which I didn't have a direct plan for initially. So that break in a creative vision helped me try something new!\r\n\r\nComing back to these songs, I also find how much they really do mean to me, no matter how strong or not they are on their own. They really communicate things I don't know how to show, and they also greatly sum up my challenges and emotions throughout time as I go. I think if you can do that with music, then it really is working. The fact that I've done these makes me really happy, this is so much to get done, it's kind of crazy. Anyone can make songs like these, but they haven't, so that's saying something. <- someone has said this and I'm quoting them, I can't remember who it was unfortunately.\r\n\r\nThe name of this project was actually planned though. It was after the song itself (I'm not sure whether the rest of the songs work towards the meaning specifically though). But the concept is that I throughout my life's experiences, I sponge up information and learn things along the way. Be it, emotions, learning from misunderstandings, new skills, challenging situations or decisions, what have you. Then I write a project to represent that (assert it, 'speak' it), and somehow it conveys those things and gets them out of my system. Then I can expunge them from my backpack of things to deal with.\r\n\r\nThis seems to be very similar of a path that Devin Townsend takes with what his music means to him. It's actually mindblowing to me that I discovered this kind of way to deal with things, and then I later discovered Devin and his music after that. So I hadn't learned that from him, I hadn't dived into his work yet. I first *heard about* him around the time of working on 'Transcend', on a trip to Mammoth, but I didn't look into him yet. It's almost like finding him wasn't supposed to happen yet, because I needed to figure it out on my own first. Then his music has absolutely clicked for me the last few months, crazy how that works out. Weird things like that seem to happen without you knowing, it's funny when it happens when you keep your eye out for it. I don't know if it means anything, but it is a bit conspicuous for life to provide that to you, it is amazing.",

        "about": "Another name randomly derived from random thoughts, or 'Broken Analogies' if you'd prefer (That's the meaning behind that song name by the way, it's the method I use to make these weird names, I correlate more than one thing together which doesn't have a plainly visible correlation).\n\nSo for some reason it was a random name 'Train Track Heart Beat', then I spelt it wrong on purpose 'TragneTrake', and make 'Hart' like you hear 'Hartland' used sometimes (for random town names and such), and 'Beet' instead of 'Beat', like the vegetable 'beetroot'. I don't know either, man.\n\nDidn't know what 'Hart' meant, looked into it with Google, turns out it's a male deer or stag. Who knew! Now 'Hartland' makes more sense, it's like 'the land of the deer'. Now I want to write that down as a song name. That might be reference to things write up here, if you end up seeing that name later, haha. That would make this broken analogy the spur for a new iteration of the naming vortex. That sounds cool too.\n\nI was thinking of redoing this song again, while finalizing the trimming of this for this project, maybe that deer name can be used for the new version.\n\nSo the rule of thumb is to come up with a random set of words or sentence/analogy that doesn't really make sense, then add your own new layers of inside jokes to it, which don't have any real meaning other than that they are the joke themselves. I feel like this is why I find doghouse jokes funny. I think I've brought that up before too.",

I didn't know what Don Quixote was about or what it was. Then I looked into the meaning, it was a book, and I think part of it happened to connect with the theme behind 'Sponge, Assert, Expunge' somehow. I can't find where it mentions how I noticed the connection between the two, but somehow it was also interestingly lining up together.\n\nThe song itself kind of feels a little derivative to me, but I think it actually might be an improvement over earlier material of mine that it comes from. So I think it's actually a good take on being derivative this time around. I think it also has some nice emotion behind it.",

    "about": "This is going great! I'm very relieved to be finally working on projects of mine from within the same year I made them. This one was also from the start of the year, around my birthday (two of the songs were made at the desert, 'Over the Ridge' was specifically on my birthday). I had a little idea that I mostly just tried on this album. The concept was to try making songs with non-instrumental things out in the world, and making music from them. It went interesting for sure, and it was a fun idea. I want to continue to expand on it, I think I just need to choose better sound sources. I really like how 'Sandy Suskatoon' turned out. We were walking around exploring some things around camp, and found an abandoned bunker thing, which had lots of old things there, I think people just left it there over time to kind of mess up the place. Kind of unfortunate and rude since it's just in the middle of the desert, but it looks cool so eeh haha. There was an old rusty metal spring mattress, and some sticks from a bush I found. That's what I was playing 'Sandy Suskatoon' on, it actually sounded really neat. 'Over the Ridge' was a stick too I think, on a metal post next to a dropdown in the canal. It didn't audibly sound that good to me, coming back to listen to that one, but it's key to the point of the project, and it sets the vibe accordingly, so I think it's a keeper. This was kind of an in-between projects project, and it was meant to be lighthearted and just a little simple. I think it works well for that.\r\n\r\nThe heavier songs were recorded just before the trip, as well as 'ROOOOaggh'. I was continuing to experiment on yet again more properly working on making a song-song, one that's memorable, and that actually sounds nice. I think my favorite is probably 'Pizza Carl'. I didn't want to push these smaller changes of ideas into the next new project just because this was small, I wanted that next one to have it's own feel, whenever it were to start fleshing out. That's part of what I've been learning with this. Sometimes your writing comes in waves. Posting these last three or four projects the last few days has come out of not having written too much the last few days, this is my choice instead of writing something new.\r\n\r\nI also want to (realistically, it's ok if I don't fully complete everything) continue with the goal of maybe getting all of my projects up before the end of the year. That was my goal at the start of the new year, at least a glimmer of a thought. At that point, I didn't even have Bandcamp set up yet! So the mark of putting this project up, is where I was at the beginning of the year, when I made my Bandcamp at the first place. So, in Feburary, this was my newest project, and I was just posting 'Flatlands' on Bandcamp I'm pretty sure. It's hard to keep track of the timelines, since things are behind still. Looking through the pictures and screenshots on my phone, it I was working on 'Centerland' when I was posting 'Elkosaurus' to Bandcamp. So yeah, that's how that lines up.\r\n\r\nI think my writing has definitely started to progress this year, I'm really happy I've continued just pumping out all of these projects. After these next few smaller ones, I have two more extra big ones (like 40 or 50 song ones 🤯), then I'm at what I've been writing the last few weeks lately. So I'm almost there! It's mid November too, so I have more time than I think. Not to say it's a lot, but it's not down to an unrealistic timeframe to be able to complete it. That's why I'm kind of pushing myself to get it out.\r\n\r\nI think my goal for 2024 will likely be to release projects that I'm actively working on, to not be behind on it anymore. I think that will be another driving factor as to help bring the quality assurance and second-takes up a bit more. I will be more okay with taking time on things like album art and improved mixing because I don't need to catch up on getting things released. I still want to go back and make the best album art for the last 6 projects or so, they aren't completely done I feel. I really like how ones like 'Streetlight' and 'Elkosaurus' turned out. I think 'Elkosaurus' took the most time out of all of the album art, and 'Streetlight' actually didn't take too long. I think the instinct came really fast for how that one should look. I really like 'Emotional Literacy', I almost feel like the art looks too good to represent the music of the actual project haha.\r\n\r\nWow this went way too long.\r\n\r\nOne more thing I forgot to mention, the desert spot is actually not very far away from the cover art for Mike Keneally and Marco Minnemann's 'Evidence of Humanity' album, pretty neat. We didn't specifically go to where the people live out there, it's just that it's the same desert in general.",

    "about": "I think I've kind of forgotten how much this album was a big step forward for me, I think it really bring up the quality of things a bit compared to previous projects. This is the first time in all of my projects where I didn't keep track of the order I wrote the songs in, since I have always up until this point ordered the tracks on the albums as they happened when writing them. So this is the first time I made a purposeful run list as to what I think sounds good together. That was a new thing, and as well as the goal of the project to be on making something more streamlined/listenable. I think it still has my style all over it, maybe just a bit less of the weird/abstract parts. It still goes in a lot of different directions across the duration of the album, but I think it was purposefully a bit more contained this time. I'm really happy with how this turned out, as sometimes when I try to go for a specific goal, I end up veering of course, and it turns into something a bit less streamlined.\r\n\r\nThings are still a little rough in that I don't really go back and perfect things later, like quantizing, or second takes for instruments, things like that. I still have liked that raw sound. As of writing this (Nov. 2023), I'm trying to work on those things a bit more, but this project wasn't too much with a concern for that yet still. The goal was instead for improving the listenability of the writing, to where it's something a bit better as to what you can follow.",

But, yeah. This one is one of my favorites from the album. It kind of feels like it goes back to reference previous ideas, I think I hear some of RESERVED A in there somehow. And I think it foreshadows upcoming projects a little bit too; this one was a nice middle-ground of ideas in a way. At least it kind of feels like it's that way.",

        "about": "This is such a great track in my opinion, it might be one of my favorite songs of mine/this album. I think I found Incubus - Science around the time of writing this one, so I think that inspired the oddness a little bit. The second half of the song is just something else, I don't really know how to describe it.\n\nThe story behind the song itself was not too much actually. It was extremely late at night, and I was literally about to go to bed. Then for some reason, I just thought of the phrase \"We're like green, introspective beings\", with that weird time signature and everything. I felt I had to record it exactly right then, because I definitely wasn't going to remember it or play it accordingly if I waited until later. That's usually how things go. Once the initial motif for the opening of the song was done, I pretty much just went all over the place with the song, didn't really have any idea where it was going or what it meant. Then it kind of found itself, and I just fully committed to the vibe. It's very dark. But it's kind of revitalizing too, it's really interesting. I think I had already started listening to Mike Keneally - Dog just a few months before that, to which I think this kind of also drew inspiration from \"This Tastes Like A Hotel\". I think I felt like I wanted to make a song that conveyed that kind of thing. I can't figure out how it links to it specifically, but a heavy amount of inspiration has come from the Porcupine Tree - Yellow Hedgerow Dreamscape album, so I think this kind of relates to my learnings from that too.\n\nCome to think of it, it also kind of might spur inspiration from C418's soundtrack for The End in Minecraft. I wasn't intentionally going for that, but only that song is the other one which makes me feel like how this one does.",

I didn't know what direction the next album was going to go in, so I didn't want to group this one with that once I started to work on it. I really like the quality of it, considering how quickly it came together, and since it's a little shorter of a song.\n\nI think it felt like a new direction also because I didn't want to go with the all-in impromptu nature of the previous album, so I tried going for a (still) improvised sound and style, but with more of a goal of making it song-oriented, something that's less consuming to listen to. Sometimes some of my songs/projects are very big, in a sense, and they are very abstract. The nature of their incompleteness is almost like the feature of what it represents. From this time and onwards, I wanted to continue to try making more listenable songs, something that you might like to listen to again, rather than it being something of a musical challenge. I guess I was doing that with Lordsmith and a few of the other previous works, but I think I kind of felt like I went back to the abstract writing with Emotional Literacy. One example being that the concept for that album was intentionally to write an album all in one setting. It was less about the art first, and more about the exercise it seemed like. The sounds and ideas on that album I really like, but it kind of runs out of depth in some spots I think.",

The album was called that, but this really is the name in terms of feel I think. As of Jun 22 2025, I am renaming it to that. Up until now, publicly it has been shown as '26'. It was called that because that's the name it had while in the works, and it kind of stuck. It was the 26th song in this album project. So as you can see a good 14 songs didn't make the cut for this project.",

I didn't go a great job at all though, so it didn't turn out really good (at all). But, since I want to share my music writing process as much as I can, I'm gonna keep it in the album anyways. I think the biggest holdup was that I couldn't find the actual lyrics for the song anywhere, so I didn't really know what to sing. I'm also not a singer (yet, hopefully! lol), so you can definitely hear that in the recording too. I recommend skipping this track if you don't at minimum find it amusing, it's definitely a bloody-ear listen haha.",

    "about": "Ok it's getting a lot easier to release these later albums, most of the songs were already leveled and everything, aaah! Not quite sure if it's the final artwork yet. I'm also not sure about the selected tracks yet, but I'm gonna try all of them because why not. Some of them make the length of the album a bit long-winded, but their vibe is really something else. And some of the ideas were incomplete too, but I'm gonna see how they fit in terms of making it an album.\r\n\r\nThe key tracks are\r\n- A Sight to Behold\r\n- Sunlight / Content\r\n- Cheddar\r\n- Some Kind of Potatoes\r\n- Meridian\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if I like/will keep 'Pug' or 'E', but I kind of just want to leave them because why not 🙂\r\n\r\nThe writing for the album started with 'Meridian', then 'A Sight to Behold' right after that. Those were on the same night! I didn't want to open the album with a dark song like 'Meridian' though, it doesn't quite fit the vibe for the rest of the album. But I might change that back around later, not sure. It sure as heck helped inspired a new writing kind for me though, so it's absolutely a keeper track as a whole, just not sure how to package it up.",

    "about": "Alright, here we are with my seventh album! This one was recently recorded from Spring to Fall 2021. Ready for it? GOOD LUCK! This one is a wild ride, if you can hang on for 1:24 of playtime.\r\nThe main goal this time around: How bad can one make an album? Some parts shine through as pretty cool, and I like that.\r\nThis is not meant to be good, that's the point! So don't be worried if I think it's good, it's meant to be hilariously bad! I think it's amazing in the sense that it's a meme album.\r\nThe later portion of the album inspired my next direction in writing for the album after this, and I can't wait to finish the production for that one so I can show you it too! It has a much different writing purpose than this one does.\r\n\r\nEdit Apr 13 2025:\r\n\r\nComing back to this later on, after listening to Larry the Silver Waterfowl (Park & Ride) from Carpincho, I had a realization. I think this counterpart to my writing is inspired heavily by Marco Minnemann's album Schattenspiel. I originally heard about it when we were getting into The Aristocrats, back when I was in middle school. I only had my own YouTube rip of the song \"Sandwich\" for the longest time. That song seems to be, looking back now, one of the biggest eye-openers for me to this kind of creativity. The way the song structure worked was like nothing I had ever heard before, the way he composed things around the drumset, which is the centerpiece of the song, rather than something like guitar or vocals. I had this song on repeat for the longest time, and I watched the video a lot. It wasn't until 2020 or 2021 that I remembered that I had never actually gotten into the full album. That was just after I had gotten into Marco's solo catalog too, so things were starting to click for me in that regard. Marco's catalog was the music theme of the pandemic for me, hands down. I think reintroducing myself with Schattenspiel at around that time resurfaced my interest in that kind of structure, and my realization that I had never tried that out before, even though I had loved it so much when I first found it. I think this album, and the style I ended up making out of it, I'd like to think could be a nod back to that. It did morph with my own style though, with the concept of making a \"bad\" album. It's like the song structure from that and the way the song is constructed is what I used to drive the process for this and the other albums early on. I think that video and song was fairly tongue-and-cheek driven to start with, but I feel I also added a little more of that into the mix. I was trying to paint a friendly omage to that, but with the concept of something like Eeps as well, where it intentionally sounded \"bad\", I think I heard Marco say at some point. So it's like if Eeps was constructed with the way Sandwich was, but also on a very low budget, aka just with GarageBand synth samples. That in and of itself is part of the joke for me too though, at least for Elkosaurus. Part of the initial joke that didn't get fully fleshed out (sadly) would also have been if I exported this album as full lossless, my thought for that being funny would be because the nerve of making the worst album ever, but then also having it be very high quality, now that's freaking hilarious. I think I still have that in the back of my mind actually, now that I'm more focused on lossless, mixing, and mastering, I definitely want to try making another horrible album sometime. Balls to the wall, yet high quality haha. Maybe it could be explicitly a double-album too. An unrelated realization right now too actually, Elkosaurus is meant to be light-hearted. Some of my work is a bit of a downer, at least sometimes it comes from a place of what might be despair, stress, or sadness. The pandemic likely was a driving factor in that regard, but Elkosaurus is meant to be humorous, not sickly self-indulgent, or self-harmful. Ah, that's the word, masochistic. I didn't want to be that. If I included something like Infinitrack, it would have raised the bar on that metric. Hence, that's why it wasn't included. This album still has it's lower parts, like around Hazy Light and Wobble Fog, but it doesn't get dark really.\r\n\r\nI think the biggest struggle with making another ridiculous album, is it will be challenging not to make it intense. Say for example the parts on HARRY and Carpincho, it gets a bit dark and masochistic, not as light-hearted as Elkosaurus. I think maybe that's part of what I was bummed about with Carpincho, now that I think about it. But for HARRY, I was in some regard, embracing it/allowing it to flow. I wasn't trying to inflate it intentionally though, which Devin mentioned he did for SYL Alien. I was fine if it went there at times, but I didn't want it to get too crazy, and destroy itself (talking about HARRY). HARRY is probably the closest thing to Elkosaurus since the original, with a few other having some aspects borrowed too. Carpincho was like Elkosaurus unhinged. If anything, Carpincho is so short because I couldn't handle the extent it was getting to, so it had to be shorter. I just ran out of writing fuel to continue at that level of energy. It also would just not be fun to listen to if it kept going. It's like you feel sick or something. Now I can look back at it and stay separate from it, and I admire the honesty in what it conveys. It is very strong though. I do want to explore something like that again, it comes from a very specific place though, and you can't force it. That's the biggest thing I've been learning and have been making note of. What I write currently is what I write currently. I can't influence the style it is, I can only curate it to reflect it better to represent myself. That's okay. The time will come when the types of albums I want to make, can be made. It just involves a set of circumstances that will lead to that happening.\r\n\r\nLove you!\r\n\r\nEdit again today:\r\n\r\nHARRY is also a bit more honest with how I was feeling at the time, mixed with that creative funness too. Maybe that's why I am really fond hearing it after the fact. It's very open, yet also light-hearted in that it doesn't worry about itself being open. Elkosaurus kind of lacks a vulnerability. It kind of is a very surface-level thing. It's great in what it is, but it has less for you to grab onto I feel. It does have it's honest parts though, I think nearing the end of the album it get's more open about feelings, almost like an inverse to HARRY, interestingly enough. I wonder if Elkosaurus is the beginning of an era, and HARRY is the end. I feel like Snake Oil is really the conclusion though, now that I'm seeing how things like that are. It depends on what aspect one looks at. It's a positive lookback though, none of these projects could have happened without the one before it. I wouldn't have them any other way ❤️\r\n\r\nEdit 3 lol:\r\n\r\nListening to Carpincho, it was almost like a joke about myself at the time. I felt lost in my writing, be it life things, having been burnt out from writing a lot, or wanting to try something new but not having many other tools to use in that regard. So it's like I started to get self-conscious about my silly writing, because I was sad that \"that's all I had\" in my toolset. Once again, I really love Carpincho now, it's very strong in what it is and where it came from. Very transparent. It is just an analysis where it comes from internally though. Elkosaurus was interested in making that aesthetic intentionally, while Carpincho was like that because it was frustrated that it was the only thing I knew how to do. So it was more of a criticism of it itself. It was also with HARRY where I had been okay again with that style, and the style itself was interesting again in a light-hearted way. It was almost like a turning point of no longer being insecure about it, and embracing it in that regard. It wasn't the specific intent to be balls-to-the-wall for HARRY though, it was more about overcoming that insecurity itself, and allowing it to be all there too. Sometime in the future, I want to use my own self-confidence to make that bold statement, probably a heavy album, as well as a silly album. I'm not sure yet whether this will be the same project or not. Ideally it would be both, but I feel like having it combined could be new to me as well. I want to make something like Elkosaurus but also like \"Maggot Twat\", \"clowncore\", and \"Time of Orchids - Melonwhisper\".",

Had a thought that I might not have encoded the original file as nicely as it could have been. There is only merely a 320k MP3 file of this song which exists. I had converted it to M4A back when adding it to my library. Looking back now, my not too deep knowledge of audio formats means I probably took the MP3, reencoded it to AAC for my own use (M4A), then simply to upload to Bandcamp, just converted that to a WAV. Not necessary to have done that. Since there is only a source MP3 to my knowledge, today I reencoded that directly to a WAV file, omitting the extra compression step which had likely removed data making the lack of lossless even more apparent. Albeit probably not very noticeable, at least now the quality is partially better here. I now see that the recording itself isn't constructed fully enough to where it would \"matter\" too much, it really was just a fun demo, glad we recorded it. Still, even then, all the bytes we can muster, why not? :D",

    "about": "Teenage Supremacy was a band a few of us from school were in together. We only played one live show, and there's not much to document it's existence, other than a few hard to find social media pages. I thought I'd bring this to light with a remaster from the video of the show, to hopefully make the audio a little easier to listen to. This is the only audio we have from our sessions for the most part, so there's only so much one can do to make the audio sound a little tidier. I tried my best with my limited knowledge in mastering, hope you enjoy!\r\n\r\n- Brandon\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_n7dfBztDw",
